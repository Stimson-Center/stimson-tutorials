A week after seizing 200 kg of endangered sea cucumbers, Marine Police of Coastal Security Group (CSG) have seized 200 kg of boiled sea cucumbers, protected under Schedule I of the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972, and detained two persons who were processing them.

A team of Marine Police personnel, led by Additional Superintendent of Police Vijaya Baskar and Inspector of Police P.S. Ramesh Kumar, was on patrolling on Tuesday on the eve of ‘Sagar Kavach,’ the comprehensive exercise to strengthen coastal security, when it found two persons processing sea cucumbers on Puliyampatti seashore in Mandapam north.

The accused — M. Sadam (26) and A. Ajmal Sha (22) — were boiling the species for processing after erecting makeshift thatched roof sheds on the seashore when the police team rounded them up and seized the species, procured by them at the behest of smugglers.

The team also seized two cooking gas cylinders, a stove and a big vessel used for boiling sea cucumbers, Mr. Ramesh Kumar said.

The accused and the endangered species were handed over to Forest Department officials, who arrested the accused under Sections 9, 39, 50 and 51 of the Wildlife Protection Act.

The two were produced before Rameswaram Magistrate Court, which remanded them in judicial custody. The seized consignment was destroyed on court orders, Forest Department sources said.

Interrogation by Marine Police revealed that the two accused had procured the species from local fishermen at the behest of smugglers, but they did not reveal the names of the smugglers. They would keep ready the processed sea cucumbers and hand them over to a contact, who visited them, they said.

This was the sixth seizure of sea cucumbers by the Marine Police since August after they stepped up the drive against smuggling of the banned species. This was the third major seizure after the police seized 200 kg of sea cucumbers on August 16 and another 200 kg on September 18.

Meanwhile, Forest Department has warned fishermen against catching the endangered species while fishing. Even if the fishermen caught them inadvertently, they should let them back into the sea, it said.
Marine police of Coastal Security Group (CSG) have seized about 200 kg of sea endangered cucumbers, protected under Schedule I of the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972, and detained a man, who procured the species from fishermen at the behest of smugglers.

Acting on a tip-off, a special team, led by Jothi Basu and Rajkumar, Sub-Inspectors of Police, CSG, visited Mandapam north seashore on Sunday morning and arrested S. Suresh Kumar (37), who collected the endangered species to be supplied to a smuggler from Vedalai.

He was shifting the fresh species from one boat to another off the north seashore, after collecting them from local fishermen when the team detained him red-handed.

He told the police that he was procuring the species on behalf of smugglers, but did not know them. A contact from Vedalai visited his house to collect the consignment, he said.

Interrogation revealed that he had been engaged in the illegal trade for sometime.

The Marine Police could not detain fishermen who supplied the species to him as he would not name or identify anyone as they had tacit understanding, the police said.

Earlier, the fishermen supplied the species to smugglers if they inadvertently caught them while fishing. But of late, they lay net to catch sea cucumbers as it fetched them more money, the police said.

The police and forest department have advised fishermen to let the sea cucumbers back into the sea if they caught them inadvertently.

Forest Range Officer (Additional charge, Mandapam range), S. Ganeshalingam arrested the accused, who was handed over to them, under Sections 9, 39, 50 and 51 of the Wildlife Protection Act. He was produced before Rameswaram Magistrate Court which remanded him in judicial custody, he said.

This was the fifth seizure made by the Marine Police since August after it stepped up the drive against procurement and sale of the banned species.

On August 16, the Marine Police seized 200 kg of sea cucumbers at Thirupalaikudi seashore and detained N. Feroz Khan (38).

Customs officials also seized heroine at the Beitbridge border post in Limpopo on Tuesday.

CAPE TOWN - Customs officials have seized dried abalone worth R1 million and heroine worth more than R300,000 in two separate busts this week.

The abalone was confiscated at Cape Town International Airport, while the drugs were seized at the Beitbridge border post in Limpopo yesterday.

The South African Revenue Service says customs officials were tipped off by airline staff about a suspicious looking consignment at a cargo shed at Cape Town International Airport.

The package turned out to be almost half a ton of dried abalone valued at approximately R1 million.

It's understood the abalone had been declared as car parts and was destined for Hong Kong.

In the second incident at the Beitbridge border post, customs inspectors intercepted a woman suspected of being a drug mule travelling from the Democratic Republic of Congo.
PHUKET: A man was arrested this weekend for his role in two Phuket-based boats illegally fishing in international waters.

“We were contacted by the Crime Suppression Division (CSD) about 37-year-old Thanongsak Raksawong being in charge of two of the six Thai-flagged boats currently under investigation for illegal fishing,” said Phuket Marine Police Chief Panya Chaichana.

Officers arrested Mr Thanongsak at Rassada Pier at about 12:30pm yesterday.

“He presented us all the documents for his company, Siam Tuna Co Ltd, and then confessed that he was the owner of Mook Anda 018 and Mook Anda 028, which had been illegally fishing in international waters,” said Col Panya.

Mr Thanongsak faces a maximum penalty of one year imprisonment, a fine of 100,000 baht or both. He was handed over to the CSD in Bangkok for further legal processing.

“We will continue to do our best to rid Thailand of illegal fishing,” confirmed Col Panya.

Last year, the European Union gave Thailand a ‘yellow card’ for its inadequate measures to stop illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing. The country was given six months to show radical improvements.

Earlier this month, Deputy Prime Minister Gen Prawit Wongsuwan boasted that Thailand was fully prepared to report on the progress of its clampdown on IUU fishing to the European Union this month (story here).

Nonetheless, global conservation organization Sea Shepherd was forced back out on the hunt for IUUs following Antarctic toothfish vessel Taishan escaping Phuket (story here). The vessel was seized for reporting its cargo as 182 tonnes of grouper, valued at about 15 million baht. However, experts later confirmed that the ship had in fact offloaded 182 tonnes of Antarctic toothfish, valued at about 179mn baht (story here).

GEORGE TOWN: Four Indonesian fishermen were nabbed near Pulau Kendi by the Malaysian Mari-time Enforcement Agency (MMEA) for encroaching into Malaysian waters.

The skipper and three crewmen, aged between 25 and 30, were stopped by an MMEA patrol boat 39 nautical miles southwest of Pulau Kendi at about 2pm on Sunday.

According to MMEA Marine 2 District enforcement chief First Admiral Kamaruszaman Abu Hassan, the fishermen had trespassed into Malaysia waters.

“We also seized their vessel, 100kg of fish and their fishing equipment.”

“The fishermen were subse-quently brought back to the Fisheries Development Authority of Malaysia in Batu Maung for further questioning,” he said in a statement yesterday.

Kamaruszaman added that the agency often received complaints from local fishermen about illegal encroachment.

“We will step up our patrols especially at the borders to prevent this prevailing activity.”

On Friday, the MMEA also detained five Indonesian fishermen near Pulau Kendi for a similar offence

The crew of the Royal Australian Navy’s guided missile frigate HMAS Melbourne made their fifth drug seizure in Operation Manitou as they seized around 65kg of heroin from a dhow in the Indian Ocean.

The hidden drugs were discovered when Melbourne’s boarding party searched a suspect vessel during Melbourne’s last maritime security patrol with the multinational Combined Maritime Forces (CMF) before handing over to HMAS Darwin and returning to Australia.

The heroin was seized and transported onboard HMAS Melbourne for further analysis before it was disposed at sea.

Specialised equipment onboard the frigate identified the drugs as mid-grade heroin valued at approximately $50M AUD (based on Australian Crime Commission figures and revised for purity).

The latest seizure brings Melbourne’s total haul of heroin intercepted for this deployment to just under a tonne (977 kg).

Commander Bill Waters, Commanding Officer of HMAS Melbourne, said: “We approached this boarding like we did for our first boarding of the deployment. The entire ship remained focussed and our results bear witness to their abilities. I am very pleased with the achievements of the Ship’s Company over the entire deployment and thankful to all at CMF for placing us in the right place at the right time to undertake this boarding.”

Melbourne is conducting maritime security operations with the CMF as part of the Australian-led Combined Task Force 150 (CTF150), one of several Task Forces assigned to CMF. Melbourne’s operations encompass the Indian Ocean and Arabian Gulf during her deployment in the Middle East Region.

CTF150 undertakes maritime security patrols in the region to counter maritime related terrorism and to intercept the trafficking of drugs and illicit cargoes that help fund international terrorist activities.

This is Melbourne’s eighth deployment to the Middle East Region and the 61st for the Royal Australian Navy since the Gulf War in 1991.

Seventy five kg of sea cucumber, an endangered coral reef species, was seized on Thursday when it was being transported from the seacoast to Mandapam near Rameswaram and four persons were arrested in this connection, police said.



Police said the sea cucumber, a delicacy in many south east Asian nations, was being transported to Mandapam en route to Sri Lanka by four persons when their car was stopped and checked by coastal marine police.



Police seized the sea cucumber and arrested them.



The worth of the sea cucumber was around Rs 7.5 lakh, the officials said.



Sea cucumbers, which play an important role in maintaining the marine ecological system, have been classified as endangered species and their harvest banned under the Wildlife Protection Act.
AHMEDABAD: Indian Coast Guard (ICG) today intercepted a Pakistani fishing boat which illegally entered into Indian maritime boundary off Jakhau coast in Kutch district and arrested 11 fishermen onboard, officials said."A fishing boat from Pakistan measuring 40 feet in length was intercepted by Indian Coast Guard off Jakhau coast, five nautical miles into Indian waters," Captain Abhishek Matiman , a defence spokesperson told PTI."Eleven fishermen onboard the fishing boat have also been held," he said.Indian and Pakistan marine security agencies often capture fishing boats for crossing into their respective maritime boundary.Around 440 Indian fishermen are at present languishing in Pakistani jails, most of whom are from Gujarat, and around 860 Indian fishing boats in the custody of Pakistan.Recently, a fishermen's organisation, in a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi , had requested him to initiate efforts to bring back jailed Indian fishermen and their boats from Pakistan.The letter was written by president of the Porbandar Fishermen Boat Association Manish Lodhari, who is also the secretary of National Fishworkers' Forum.
Four Maritime Affairs and Fisheries Ministry's fisheries and marine resource surveillance unit patrol boats have detained seven Malaysian-flagged fishing vessels for allegedly trawling for fish in Indonesian territory, the Malacca Strait.

All crew on the fishing vessels are alleged to be Indonesian citizens who had been illegally employed by Malaysian businessmen to fish without permits in Indonesian waters.

The ministry's fisheries and marine resource surveillance unit head Akhmadon said that it was not uncommon for Malaysian companies to employ Indonesian people, without providing them with legal work documents, to carry out illegal fishing activities in Indonesian waters.

'Not only are they fishing in our territories illegally, they have also used fishing vessels equipped with trawls, which are prohibited as they are destructive to the local marine environment,' Akhmadon told thejakartapost.com on Sunday.

The ministry said the seven Malaysian vessels were detained on Feb.1, along with the 36 crew members, all Indonesians.

The captain of fishing vessel KM SLFA 2915, Indra, 34, a resident of Tanjung Balai Asahan, North Sumatra, said that, by using a tourist passport, he entered Malaysia to work as a construction worker two years ago. His experience as a seaman had eventually led Indra to work for a fishing company in Negeri Perak, Malaysia.

'In Asahan, only a few fishing companies were still operating. That's why I was okay to work as a fisherman in Malaysia, as a captain of a fishing vessel. Besides, working in Malaysia, I was able to get quite a high income,' said Indra, claiming that as a captain he was paid RM 100 (US$24.10) per day.

A crew member of a fishing vessel, he added, could get RM 70 per day, far higher than in Indonesia where a daily salary is a mere Rp 50,000 ($3.71) per day.

Indra said that he and the 35 other fishermen were fully aware that they were in Indonesian territories but that they kept fishing in the area, no matter what, due to the high catch potential.

Berton, another of the arrested crew members, also said that the income he could receive from working for a Malaysian fishing company was far higher than what he would receive working for an Indonesian company.

'Thus, we decided to work for Malaysian companies and fish in Indonesian territories. Higher income was the only reason for us to do this,' said Berton.

Akhmadon said the seven Malaysian fishing vessels had been operating in waters around the Malacca Strait for some time before they were caught by the ministry's sea patrols. They would be charged with Law No.31/2004 on Fisheries which carries a penalty of five years in prison and Rp 2 billion fines, he went on.

'Once there is a final court ruling, we will sink all of those vessels, while the suspects, who are all Indonesians, will be repatriated to their home towns,' said Akhmadon. (ebf)
KARACHI: The Maritime Security Agency (MSA) on Saturday arrested 88 Indian fishermen for fishing in Pakistani waters, an official said.

“The Indian fishermen were arrested by the MSA while they were fishing in Pakistani waters of the Arabian Sea in the early hours of Saturday,” said an official at the Docks police station.

“Their (Indian fishermen’s) 16 fishing boats have also been seized by the MSA. They were later handed over to police from where they would be produced before the respective courts.”

He said the Docks police had registered a case against the arrested Indian fishermen on behalf of the state under Sections 3/4 of the Foreign Act and 3/9 of the Fishery Act.

The arrest of Indian fishermen came as third such incident in three months after the two countries agreed in Dec 2015 to reinitiate the dialogue process during Indian external affairs minister Sushma Swaraj visit to Pakistan.

However, the scheduled talks between the foreign secretaries of the two countries were postponed after the Pathankot airbase attack in India last month.

The fisheries officials said that the release and exchange of fishermen had also come to a halt from the two sides for the past several months causing concern among the families of their arrested loved ones on both sides of the border.

KARACHI: The Maritime Security Agency (MSA) on Saturday arrested 20 more Indian fishermen for fishing in Pakistani waters, an official said.

“The Indian fishermen were arrested by the MSA while they were fishing in Pakistani limits of the Arabian Sea,” said an official at the Docks police station. “Their [Indian fishermen’s] four fishing boats have also been seized by the MSA. We are in the process of taking their custody from the MSA. They will be then produced in court.”

He said a case under Sections 3/4 of the Foreigners Act and 3/9 of the Fishery Act was registered for the offence against the Indian fishermen. The fresh arrest of Indian fishermen came as the second of its kind within a week, as on Feb 20 the MSA authorities had arrested 88 fishermen of the neighbouring country while they were fishing in Pakistani territorial limits of the sea.

Meanwhile, an official at the Fishermen’s Cooperative Society said the release and exchange of arrested fishermen had been halted for the past many months as apart from more than 150 Indian fishermen in Pakistani prisons, more than 50 Pakistan fishermen were in Indian jails, causing concern among the families of the arrested men on both sides of the border.

A foreign illegal fishing vessel with unknown number of Iranian fishermen on-board has escaped from Bosaso port in the Northern autonomous Puntland region of Somalia where it was being held, Horseed Media reports.

The unidentified boat, was one of the five illegal fishing trawlers captured by the Puntland Maritime Police Forces off coast Puntland waters last week for illegally fishing.

According to sources, the vessel took off Friday mid night after its guards left the area briefly. Bosaso port guards fired warning shots at the boat but it managed to flee.



Puntland officials have declined to clearly comment on the reason behind the escape of the detained boat and fishermen awaiting trial.

The autonomous region has launched a major crackdown on the illegal fishing vessels in its waters over the past few weeks, capturing at least eight vessels with over 150 crew members.

Illegal, Unreported, and Unregulated fishing activities have reached at their highest peak in the horn of Africa nation waters.

NAIROBI (Reuters) - An Australian Navy ship has seized a huge cache of weapons near Oman’s coast from a fishing vessel bound for Somalia, the navy said on Monday, exposing a possible violation of a U.N. Security Council arms embargo.

The United Nations has a decades-long arms embargo in place against Somalia, which has been mired in conflict since civil war broke out in 1991.

The Australian navy, which patrols waters around the Indian Ocean as part of an international maritime force, said it had seized nearly 2,000 AK-47 rifles, 100 rocket-propelled grenade launchers, 49 PKM machine guns, 39 PKM spare barrels and 20 mortar tubes from the fishing vessel.

“The weapons were seized under United Nations sanctions, which authorize interdiction on the high seas of illicit weapons destined for Somalia,” the navy said in a statement.

In 2013, the U.N Security Council eased some of the embargo restrictions, allowing the Western-backed government in Mogadishu to buy light weapons to bolster its armed forces in the battle against Islamist al Shabaab insurgents, who are aligned with al Qaeda.

One Western security source said the street value of the Australian Navy haul appeared to be more than $2 million.

The Australian Navy did not indicate who was the intended recipient of the weapons, which were found hidden under fishing nets. As well as al Shabaab, some regional states in Somalia operate and equip their own militias without the approval of the central government.

A Somali government spokesman could not immediately comment on the Australian Navy statement.

The navy said personnel from HMAS Darwin had boarded the fishing vessel about 170 nautical miles (313 km) off the coast of Oman to verify which flag it was sailing under and they determined that it was stateless.

HMAS Darwin is in the region as part of the Combined Task Force 150, responsible for counter-terrorism operations, curbing piracy and drug smuggling.

Last night, customs officials arrested two women and seized 63 kilos of European eels as well as 46 kilos of dried shark fin.

The European eels were found inside the check-in luggage of the two arrested passengers, who were arriving from Spain via Turkey. The 63 kilos were spread among four different pieces of luggage.



The passengers apparently made no attempt to conceal the eels inside the luggage. Photo: Hong Kong Customs.

Later, officials found the 46 kilos of dried shark fin, believed to be from smooth hammerheads sharks, inside an unclaimed bag.

The cases were handed over to the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department.

According to the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN), European eels are critically endangered while smooth hammerheads are considered “vulnerable”. The Hong Kong government considers both to be endangered.

It’s the fourth time this year that customs officials have seized European eels from air passengers. The eels are considered a delicacy in Japan and Europe.

Under the Protection of Endangered Species of Animals and Plants Ordinance, importing an endangered species without a licence can be punishable by a fine of HKD5 million and two years’ imprisonment.

Dutch Navy’s HNLMS De Zeven Provinciën, in collaboration with the Caribbean Coast Guard, intercepted around 600 kilos of cocaine north of the Venezuelan coast, March 5.

The intervention came shortly after the frigate’s first bust on its Caribbean deployment when the ship captured more than 400 kilograms of marijuana.

This time, drugs were seized from two Venezuelan fishing boats which were discovered by the patrol aircraft of the Caribbean Coastguard.

Just before sunrise, the navy ship and its embarked Alouette III helicopter from the Belgian Navy surprised the boats during a patrol. When the crews became aware that they had been seen, they threw the packages of drugs overboard. The crew of De Zeven Provinciën however managed to recover the majority of the contraband.

A total of 600 kilos of cocaine were seized while the smuggler boats and their crew were transferred to the Venezuelan Coast Guard.
WILLEMSTAD - The crew of the navy ship Zr. Ms. The Seven Provinces has intercepted 600 kilos of cocaine on the coast of Venezuela.

According to an announcement of the Ministry of Defense, the drug was found last Thursday.

Two suspected Venezuelan fishing boats were spotted from a plane. “We have surprised both boats before sunrise with our helicopter and small fast boats that we have on board,” said Commander Jansen.

US Law Enforcement Detachment which accompanied the crew on the Zr. Ms. The Seven Provinces especially for these actions, have searched both boats for contraband. A total of 600 kg of cocaine was seized. The suspect boats and their crew have been transferred to the Venezuelan Coast Guard.

This was the second drug interception this week for the crew of the navy ship Zr. Ms. The Seven Provinces.

During the first action, the navy intercepted 400 kg of marijuana.


PANGANDARAN, Indonesia — Indonesian authorities on Monday bombed the last major ship internationally wanted for years of illegally taking toothfish from southern waters, reiterating a strong message to would-be poachers who enter the country's waters. The navy seized the Nigeria-flagged Viking on Feb. 25 operating in waters off Tanjung Berakit in Riau Islands province south of Singapore. It was one of the half dozen ships dubbed the "Bandit 6'' by the non-profit Sea Shepherd Conservation Society, which hunted the boats and was among those who alerted Indonesian officials when the Viking entered the country's waters. "This is to serve as a deterrent to others,'' Fisheries Minister Susi Pudjiastuti told reporters. She posed on the beach with a group of navy officials, their fists raised in the air with the smoking boat behind them. "You may go freely in the rest of the world, but once entering Indonesia, this is the consequence." The Viking was operating as a so-called ghost ship, frequently changing its name and registry and not broadcasting any type of satellite signal so that its whereabouts could be tracked, said Siddharth Chakravarty, Sea Shepherd's campaign leader, by satellite phone from a ship in the Indian Ocean.

(Photo: AP) "I wish there were more governments standing up for what they can do within their legal instruments and not worry about how international diplomacy is going to play out after that," he said, adding that the Viking had been fishing for 13 years in Antarctica and spotted 18 times, but it always escaped. The Viking was the last in operation of the "Bandit 6'' known to be illegally catching toothfish in the Southern Ocean. Patagonian toothfish, also known as Chilean sea bass, is popularly served in the United States, and fishing stocks are now better managed after years of plundering. However, U.S.-based Monterey Bay Aquarium Seafood Watch recommends avoiding eating the fish unless it comes from certain areas. The Viking's Chilean captain and crew members have been detained in Indonesia. Interpol went after the ship in 2013 following a complaint from Norwegian authorities about illegal fishing in that country's waters. "This is just a first step,'' said Stig Traavik, Norway ambassador to Indonesia who witnessed the bombing. "In the future, it will be much more difficult to do illegal fishing, and the fish catch for local fishermen will go up.'' Huge plumes of smoke and flames engulfed the Viking after the explosives were detonated. Part of the ship will be set up as a monument to mark the country's fight against illegal fishing.

KUALA TERENGGANU: The Malaysian Maritime Enforcement Agency has seized three boats and detained 42 Vietnamese crew members in raids to thwart illegal intrusion and fishing in Malaysian waters.







Terengganu MMEA enforcement chief Maritime Captain Zainolabidin Jusoh said those detained were aged between 16 and 58 while some 8.5 tonnes of fish and dried squid were seized together with equipment worth about RM200,000.





The first raid occurred 51 nautical miles off Tanjung Mat Amin at 12.25pm on Thursday, when seven Vietnamese crew and the skipper were detained, he said at a press conference at the MMEA office here on Monday.





"At 6.33pm on the same day, another boat with 15 Vietnamese crew and the skipper were detained about 90 nautical miles off Kuala Terengganu," Capt Zainolabidin said.





Some 14 hours later, at about 8.20am on Friday, the enforcement team raided a cargo boat 32 nautical miles from Kuala Terengganu and detained another 20 Vietnamese fishermen.





"They showed us a copy of a suspicious-looking boat licence. Even if the licence were genuine, it is illegal for a cargo boat to carry out any sort of fishing activities here," Capt Zainolabidin said.





A 14-day remand order had been obtained against those detained.
Two men were arrested in Barendrecht on Tuesday in connection with the discovery of 1,200 kilograms of cocaine on a fishing boat in January. The men, a 41 year old from Winschoten and a 45 year old from Oldambt, are suspected of large-scale drug smuggling, ANP reports.

The suspects are crew members of tugboat Marian V, which left from Paramaribo to Rotterdam at the end of December. The Public Prosecutor believes that the shipment of the cocaine was transferred from this tugboat to the fishing boat Zeeland.

On January 15th fishing boat Zeeland got into trouble in a storm and called for help. The Coast Guard and rescue society KNRM rescued the four crew members on board. The boat rand to ground on the coast of Cadzand, where the police found packages of pure cocaine on board. The vessels captain was arrested that same day.

The Public Prosecutor believes that more arrests will follow in the near future.

Argentina’s coast guard sank a Chinese trawler that was fishing illegally in its territorial waters after it tried to ram a coast guard boat, authorities said on Tuesday.



In the high-seas chase a coast guard vessel on Monday pursued the Lu Yan Yuan Yu 010 toward international waters, firing warning shots across the Chinese boat’s bow as it attempted to raise the crew by radio.

“On several occasions the offending ship performed manoeuvres designed to force a collision with the coast guard, putting at risk not only its own crew but coast guard personnel, who were then ordered to shoot parts of the vessel,” the coast guard said in a statement.

The crew abandoned ship when the vessel began to go down. Four were rescued by the coast guard while others were picked up by another Chinese vessel shadowing the pursuit.

The drama marks a first test for relations between centre-right President Mauricio Macri and Beijing.

China illegally fishing off coast of west Africa, Greenpeace study reveals Read more

A spokesman for Argentina’s foreign ministry said the judiciary was investigating the incident. Comment was sought from the Chinese embassy in Buenos Aires.

The coast guard used radar to pick up the trawler fishing off the coast of Puerto Madryn, Chubut province, a zone known for squid.

Shots were fired into the hull of the Lu Yan Yuan Yu 010 after it ignored radio calls to allow the Argentine coast guard to board as well as repeated warning fire, the Argentinian authorities said.

China has the world’s largest distant water fishing fleet, with more than 2,000 vessels according to the not-for-profit group Stop Illegal Fishing.
JAKARTA, Indonesia — China’s Coast Guard rammed one of the country’s fishing boats to pry it free from the Indonesian authorities who had seized it over the weekend, angering the Indonesian government and heightening yet another diplomatic dispute over the South China Sea.

The boat was stopped for fishing illegally in Indonesia’s waters and was being towed to port when the Chinese took it back, leaving its crew in the hands of Indonesia. Jakarta reacted with uncharacteristic fury, summoning the Chinese ambassador to a meeting on Monday.

The high-seas confrontation also indicated that Indonesia might be toughening its stance toward China in the region.

It began at 10 p.m. on Saturday when a special task force vessel operated by the Indonesian Ministry of Maritime Affairs and Fisheries caught a Chinese fishing boat within Indonesia’s maritime 200-mile exclusive economic zone, off the Natuna Islands northwest of Borneo, said Arrmanatha Nasir, a spokesman for Indonesia’s Foreign Ministry.
The Navy said the Sri Lanka Coast Guard arrested three Indian fishermen for illegal poaching in Sri Lankan waters.

The fishermen along with one Indian fishing trawler were taken into custody in North-West of Delft Island, Xinhua reported.

The Navy said the arrested fishermen were handed over to the officials of the Department of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources in Jaffna.

Sri Lanka and India have been trying to resolve the long standing fishermen issue with fishermen from both sides having to face arrest and boats being detained when they stray into each other’s waters illegally.

Last month, Indian Foreign Minister Sushma Swaraj, who was in Colombo to attend the India-Sri Lanka Joint Commission, held discussions with her Sri Lankan counterpart over the issue and both countries accepted to find a long lasting solution.

Indian media reports recently quoted Swaraj as saying that a meeting of ministers dealing with fisheries from India and Sri Lanka will be convened in May to evolve a mechanism to resolve the lingering issue.

The Indian minister also said her Government will enforce installation of GPS systems on fishing boats to steer them clear of maritime boundaries. (Colombo Gazette)
The French FREMM destroyer FS Provence discovered and seized a large weapons cache following the boarding of a dhow in the Northern Indian Ocean. At the time FS Provence was operating as part of the Combined Maritime Forces Combined Task Force 150 (CTF 150), which conducts maritime security and counter terrorism operations.

The dhow was spotted heading toward Somalia by Provence’s Caïman helicopter whilst it was undertaking routine surveillance in the Northern Indian Ocean. Subsequently, Provence boarded the dhow and determined that it was without nationality. Provence then undertook a search of the vessel, during which the weapons were discovered. The haul included several hundred AK47 assault rifles, machine guns and anti-tank weapons.

As illicit weapons were deemed to be destined for Somalia, they were seized under the United Nations Security Council mandated arms embargo in accordance with UNSCR 2244(2015). The Commanding Officer of Provence commented: “This success remains a collective one, showing the value of like-minded nations committing ships and aircraft for the common good.”

“France has been supporting Combined Maritime Forces operations since their inception. This seizure is another French contribution to the stabilisation of the region.” said a CMF spokesperson.

TAIPEI • The Taiwanese coast guard has said it has arrested 41 Chinese fishermen in possession of 15 tonnes of illicit coral reef and endangered turtles near a disputed atoll in the South China Sea.

The Taiwanese authorities detained the fishermen on March 22 after their 300-ton vessel was discovered operating illegally off the shore of Tongsha Island, the coast guard said yesterday, in Taiwan's largest mission targeting rampant poaching in the contested waters.

Officials later recovered the harvested reef from the ship, along with three endangered turtles and about 40kg of chemicals used to kill fish.

"The damage they caused to the Tongsha ecological system is hard to estimate," Mr Allen Chen, a research fellow at Taiwan's Biodiversity Research Centre, told Agence France-Presse.

"The Chinese ship would have earned a large fortune if it could have sped away with the huge amount of valuable reef and sold it at home," he said.

Mr Chen added that Chinese demand for coral has surged in tandem with its continued economic development.

The atoll resides about 240 nautical miles from Taiwan's southern Kaohsiung port and is also claimed by China.

Prosecutors are preparing to indict the Chinese crew on charges of violating a wildlife protection law and the statutes governing trade between Taiwan and the mainland.

If convicted, the fishermen could face up to a year in jail, along with fines.

Taiwan and China split in 1949 at the end of a civil war, but ties have improved since 2008 after the China-friendly Kuomintang came to power on the island.

Rival claimants in the South China Sea have been beefing up their military presence in the disputed region, and other countries have complained that China is becoming increasingly aggressive in pressing its case.

China claims virtually all of the South China Sea, while the Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei and Taiwan also have partial claims.

The resource-rich South China Sea is an important waterway through which US$5.3 trillion (S$7.2 trillion) of trade passes annually.

AGENCE FRANCE-PRESSE
Two Vietnamese ships have been caught illegally fishing in the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park.

The boats, carrying 28 crew members, were intercepted by Australian Border Force officials at the weekend.

The men were caught with a large amount of diving gear and hundreds of kilograms of what is suspected to be illegally caught sea cucumbers.

The two ships were initially spotted from the air, before they were intercepted and boarded by officers from HMAS Childers and ABFC Roebuck Bay near the Lockhart River region, between the Torres Strait and Cooktown.

The vessels were towed to Cairns where further investigations will be undertaken by the Australian Fisheries Management Authority.

The 28 men are expected to be placed into immigration detention in the meantime.

Lockhart River Mayor Wayne Butcher said he was unaware of any previous activities involving illegal fishers accessing the remote waters.

"It's a very rich environment for fisheries...for foreigners to get past the gate and tap into our resource, that's just an extra burden on our fisheries," he said.

"It's a bit frightening in one sense if they can sneak through the Torres Strait and get down (here) because we're one of the last communities on the east coast of Australia. We're in the middle of nowhere here."

Mayor Butcher said Cape York residents took their role as part of the coastal surveillance network very seriously, but the recent incursion had raised questions about the effectiveness of border protection in the region.

"It doesn't seem too effective if two vessels with 28 people on board have been able to sneak so far down the Australian coastline," he said.

"Looking at the influx of boat people and now looking at the fishing fleet coming so far down the Cape now, I think there's probably some alarm bells ringing there."
UPDATE: THE twenty-eight Vietnamese fishermen who were caught illegally angling off the Far Northern coastline will be detained and trialled in Darwin.

The Australian Fisheries Management Authority (AFMA) has confirmed the international crew have been taken to immigration detention in Darwin, while the authority conducts its investigation of the matter.

The authority’s spokeswoman said the likely judicial proceedings would be conducted in Darwin Magistrates Court at a later day.

The two fishing vessels, which were found with a haul of at least 30 barrels of Beche-de-mer (sea cucumbers) remain in AFMA custody, anchored offhsore from Cairns.

The fate of these vessels will be determined as part of the investigation.

EARLIER: COMMERCIAL fishermen have applauded the largest haul of illegal foreign fishers in Great Barrier Reef waters in more than 30 years.

Two Vietnamese fishing vessels were apprehended at the weekend in waters off Lockhart River, 800km north of Cairns, by the Australian Border Force and Australian Fisheries Management Authority.

Officers detained 28 crew members, a large amount of diving gear, and at least 30 barrels of illegally caught beche-de-mer (sea cucumbers).

The Queensland east coast beche-de-mer fishing is one of the oldest fisheries in the state, and also considered one of the most sustainable.

The fishery in other parts of the world, especially Asia, is heavily exploited.

The two Viet vessels were initially spotted by a Dash-8 aircraft, with personnel from HMAS Childers and ABF vessel Roebuck Bay boarding and apprehending the vessels shortly after.

The vessels were towed into Cairns yesterday morning, while crew members were processed at HMAS Cairns base for immigration detention.

While on-board HMAS Childers, several fishermen were photographed laughing, apparently in good spirits.

An AFMA spokeswoman said the authority would conduct further investigations to determine what, if any, offences had been committed, and who was responsible.

She said penalties could include maximum fines of up to $1.35 million and the possible forfeiture of the vessels, catch and fishing equipment.

ABF Maritime Border Commander Rear Admiral Peter Laver said officers had toiled to ensure our waters stayed free from illegal fishing.

“While most of us enjoyed a break over the long weekend, our officers at sea, and in the air, were hard at work in making these apprehensions,” he said.

AFMA fisheries operations general manager Peter Venslovas said the episode was a reminder Australia must remain vigilant in protecting its marine resources.

Industry sources said the last significant capture of illegal fishermen within Great Barrier Reef waters occurred in 1984, however smaller captures occurred in the Torres Strait this month, and off the east coast of Queensland in November 2008.

Queensland Seafood Industry Association CEO Eric Perez said the capture of Vietnamese fishermen off the Far North was surprising, but applauded the efforts of authorities in catching them.

“We’ve got enough problems trying to maintain our fisheries to ensure they stay in good condition to have them being raided by non-Australian fishing vessels,’’ he said.

The Thai navy Saturday seized five Vietnamese fishing boats with 47 men on board for allegedly illegally entering Thai waters.

Vice Admiral Rangsarit Sattayanukul, commander of the 1st Regional Command, said at a press conference Sunday that the crew are being held in a police station in Chonburi Province, 200 km from Bangkok.

Four of the five boats are from Ca Mau Province and the other is from Kien Giang Province, both in the Mekong Delta.

Just a day earlier Thai authorities had seized two Vietnamese fishing boats with 12 fishermen in Songkhla Province 968 km south of Bangkok. A Vietnamese interpreter for Thai officers told Thanh Nien that one of the crew panicked and jumped into the sea and was yet to be found.

The remaining men were taken to a local police station.
AUSTRALIAN authorities have seized an Indonesian fishing boat and detained its crew for allegedly operating illegally off WA’s north coast.

The KM MASRAWATI was spotted by surveillance aircraft about 10 nautical miles from Colbert Island, intercepted by a Royal Australian Navy vessel and then boarded by Australian Border Force officials, who found shark fishing equipment and a 50-metre-long gill net.

The boat has been taken to Darwin where eight crew members were being questioned by the Australian Fisheries Management Authority.
Vietnam has seized a Chinese vessel for encroaching into its territorial waters, state media has reported. The seizure is the latest sign of heightened tensions among nations in increasingly fraught disputes over rights to the South China Sea.

The Chinese vessel with its captain and two sailors has been towed into the northern port city of Hai Phong and is currently in the custody of Vietnamese authorities. The captain and sailors are under arrest, the BBC reports. There was no immediate response from China.

Vietnamese officials said the boat was disguised as a fishing boat but was transporting 100,000 litres of diesel oil that was to be sold to Chinese fishing boats operating illegally in Vietnamese territorial waters. Hanoi officials said the captain admitted that was the purpose of the vessel. It was stopped near the Vietnamese island of Bach Long Vi and the Chinese island of Hainan.

Authorities said the coastguard had recently chased more than 100 Chinese fishing boats out of Vietnamese territorial waters. It's very unusual for the Vietnamese to seize boats.

But Vietnamese fishermen are increasingly complaining about harassment, attacks and theft of their catches confiscated by Chinese authorities while they fish in the South China Sea.

Vietnam is locked in a territorial dispute with China in the South China Sea. Beijing claims most of the South China Sea region as its sovereign territory. The area archipelago comprising about 750 islands and reefs is believed to be rich in oil and gas resources, and the sea includes one of the busiest shipping lanes in the world.

The chain of islands has become the focus of an international dispute in recent years, with Taiwan, Japan, the Philippines and Vietnam embroiled in overlapping claims of the region.

Vietnam, China and Taiwan all have competing claims over the Paracel islands which are occupied by China. The three nations — along with the Philippines, Malaysia and Brunei — have also claimed parts or all of the Spratly islands. China has recent asserted massive land reclamation of reefs and atolls in the Spratlys, and has increased military manoeuvres in the two island chains.

Japan has dispatched two warships and a submarine to the contested Subic port in the area. Though the deployment was downplayed as a routine visit, it appeared to be a show of power amid the South China Sea contentions.
Vietnamese Arrested for Illegal Fishing

Four Vietnamese fishermen who were arrested for allegedly illegally crossing the maritime border into Cambodian waters in Koh Kong province to fish were charged and sent to prison yesterday, according to a municipal court official.



Vin Youngnoeuy, 33, Nguyen Youngmi, 32, Choeng Youngco, 34, and Yoeung Thanhay, 41, were charged with “crossing into Cambodia without permission and illegal fishing (in Cambodian waters)” under article 29 of the Cambodian Law on Immigration and article 98 of the Law on Fishery, Investigative Judge Pich Vichea Thour said.



He added that the men were arrested by police in Kirisakor district on February 26. They are now detained in Prey Sar Prison.



Major Ly Sovannara, a penal police officer at the Ministry of Interior, said the men were arrested in Cambodian waters while using illegal electric nets.



“They illegally crossed the maritime border into Cambodian waters to catch fish in Koh Kong province. They used electric fishing gear to catch fish in Cambodian waters,” he said.



“They were arrested while they were catching fish. But another 20 Vietnamese fishermen escaped across the Vietnamese maritime border while our police forces were cracking down,” he added.



He said that after the four were arrested, police confiscated two power boats and illegal fishing paraphernalia. If found guilty, the men could each face three to five years in prison.
GEORGE TOWN: Maritime authorities here have detained five Indonesian fishermen, including two teens, for encroaching into Penang waters yesterday.

In the 12.45pm swoop, the foreign boat was spotted fishing in Malaysian waters some 40 nautical miles southwest of Penang Island.

Malaysian Maritime Enforcement Agency (MMEA) Penang Maritime District 2 director First Adm Kamaruszaman Abu Hassan said their 100kg catch was also seized.

“A skipper and four crew members aged between 16 and 26 were detained.

“They did not have valid identification and have been brought to the Batu Maung shipyard to be investigated,” he said in a statement today.

Kamaruszaman said to date, 11 illegal Indonesian fishermen’s boats were caught encroaching into Penang waters this year.

He urged those who spotted illegal fishing and encroachment to dial 999 or contact the MMEA operations centre hotline at 04-2626-146.
GEORGE TOWN: The Malaysian Maritime Enforcement Agency (MMEA) has arrested 12 Indonesians, including three teenagers for fishing illegally in Penang waters.

MMEA District 2 chief Maritime First Admiral Kamaruszaman Abu Hassan said a patrol team from MMEA spotted the vessels some 46.6 nautical miles southwest of Pulau Kendi at about 11am on Monday.

"A check showed that both the Indonesian vessels did not have registration numbers and they also did not possess fishing permits from the director-general of Malaysian Fisheries Department.

"Therefore, we arrested the two skippers and 10 crewmen, aged between 16 and 50," he told a press conference at the MMEA jetty in Batu Maung, near here, on Monday.

He said preliminary investigation showed that the vessels departed from Medan in Indonesia on Apr 12.

"We seized 550kg of catch and the vessels have also been impounded for further investigations," he said.

Kamaruszaman said the fishermen had violated Section 15 (1)(a) of the Fisheries Act 1985 for fishing in Malaysian waters without permission, which carries a maximum fine of RM1mil for the skippers, and RM100,000 for each crew member, upon conviction.

Kamaruszaman added that the agency noted that many Indonesian vessels have encroached into Malaysian waters and were nabbed at the Southwest of Pulau Kendi.

Kamaruszaman added that the majority of Indonesian vessels encroaching into the waters off Penang were caught in the southwest of Pulau Kendi.

"We have detained 13 vessels in that area since early this year," he said.

He said the agency would continue with patrolling efforts to ensure no illegal activities in Penang waters.

He noted that all of them were from Pantai Labu in Medan, Indonesia.
KUALA LUMPUR - At least three Malaysian fishing boats have been detained by Indonesian authorities, drawing protest from Kuala Lumpur over an alleged breach of understanding between the two nations.

It is the latest in a growing dispute over dwindling fish stocks in the region.

Malaysia's foreign ministry said in a statement on Tuesday (April 19) that the "arrest may have happened in Malaysian waters".

"The arrest is not consistent with understanding reached between Malaysia and the Republic of Indonesia in handling fisheries-related incidents," it said.

It added that Foreign Minister Anifah Aman has raised the matter with his Indonesian counterpart Retno Marsudi.

The Malaysian envoy in Pekanbaru has travelled to Batam to ensure the well-being of the captains of the fishing boats, the statement said.

On Sunday, Malaysia had also detained two Indonesian fishing boats, alleging that 550 kg of fish were found on board.

Related Story MFA in contact with Indonesia over detention of boat with Singaporeans on board

On the same evening, the Indonesian navy also held a boat captained by a Singaporean for allegedly fishing in Indonesian waters without permission.

Since 2014, Indonesia has sunk some 170 vessels caught poaching in Indonesian waters and impounded 700 others.

Most of the sunk ships were from Vietnam and the Philippines. Last year, two Singapore-registered ships were detained when they entered Indonesian waters in the Strait of Malacca and near Batam.

Malaysia and Indonesia have also been embroiled in disputes with China over hundreds of Chinese boats alleged to be fishing in South-east Asian territory. But China has insisted these vessels were in traditional Chinese fishing waters.

PRAIA (Reuters) - Authorities in Cape Verde have seized 280 kilograms of cocaine in a bust in the Atlantic from a Brazil-registered fishing vessel as it prepared to transfer the drugs to a U.S.-flagged yacht, the Cape Verde judiciary police and coast guard said on Monday.

They arrested four Brazilians, one Cape Verdean and a Russian and have since conducted searches in the capital Praia and in Assomada, on Santiago island, seizing weapons, ammunition, satellite phones and around $50,000. [nL8N12D2KG]

The bust happened when the fishing vessel ran out of fuel and the yacht arrived carrying 450 litres of fuel, apparently to restock the fishing vessel and transfer the drugs, a senior police official said.

Cape Verde, an Atlantic archipelago of 500,000 people, is the West African nation that has shown the most determination tackling gangs smuggling Latin American cocaine to Europe via the region. [nL8N1364VL]
TEN crew members of a foreign fishing vessel have been detained in the Torres Strait after being found with around 250kg of beche-de-mer (sea cucumbers).

The group was apprehended by members of the Australian Border Force with the substantial catch.

The incident comes less than a month after 28 illegal Vietnamese fishermen were caught off Lockhart River with at least 30 barrels of sea cucumbers.

The Queensland east coast beche-de-mer fishing is one of the oldest fisheries in the state, and also considered one of the most sustainable.

The fishery in other parts of the world, especially Asia, is heavily exploited.

Commander Maritime Border Command, Rear Admiral Peter Laver warned illegal fishing activities will be detected.

“Our officers continue to monitor our vast maritime domain in order to protect the nation’s fisheries,” he said.

A second vessel carrying nine foreigners has also been detailed off Western Australia for illegal fishing after being found with fishing equipment.

Autoridades colombianas informaron que interceptaron a una embarcación de bandera jamaiquina, la cual habría estado realizando pesca ilegal en aguas nacionales, entre las que estaría una especie de protegida.

El capitán de la embarcación, de nombre ‘Revelation’, no supo explicar a los guardacostas de la Armada Nacional su presencia en aguas colombianas ni la procedencia de la carga que transportaba.

“La embarcación fue interceptada en cercanías a la isla Cayo Serrana, transportando una tonelada de pesca de pez loro y bocayete, el primero de ellos considerado especie protegida de la Reserva de Biosfera de Sea Flower”, le dijo a EL TIEMPO el contralmirante Andrés Vásquez Villegas, comandante del Comando Específico de San Andrés y Providencia.

El oficial señaló que tras ser sorprendido el capitán de la embarcación justificó su presencia en cercanías a la isla colombiana, aludiendo supuestos daños en el motor que lo habrían dejado a la deriva, pero las autoridades colombianas no tuvieron conocimiento del hecho como lo obligan los protocolos marítimos.

“La embarcación fue localizada por la tripulación del buque ARC ‘20 de Julio’, que adicional a la pesca encontró a 27 personas a bordo, siete embarcaciones artesanales tipo chalupa, nueve motores y siete compresores de aire con mangueras”, resaltó el contralmirante Vásquez, quien señalo que las características de la embarcación son un clara muestra de que estaban realizando una faena de pesca ilegal en nuestro territorio.

El pesquero fue remolcado hasta San Andrés por unidades de la Armada Nacional donde quedó a disposición de las autoridades competentes.

Gaza Border (TPS) – A Gazan fisherman involved in weapons smuggling into Gaza was arrested in April and has revealed detailed information on Hamas’ attempts to utilize fishermen for military purposes, the Shin Bet announced on Monday.

Salim Gamal Hasan Na’aman, 39 years old from the Shati Refugee Camp in the Gaza Strip, worked as a fisherman and was arrested by IDF naval forces after exiting the permitted fishing area.

In his interrogation, Na’aman revealed that he has long been involved in the smuggling of weapons and arms meant for Hamas and other terror organizations in Gaza. His sea-smuggling operation moved ammunition into Gaza, including liquid fiberglass used to produce rockets, the Shin Bet said.

Na’aman also revealed details of Hamas operational maritime plans “to utilize fishermen to conceal its activities,” the Shin Bet said. Additional information revealed by Na’aman pertained to maritime routes used to smuggle goods from Egypt into Gaza, and to the use made of fishermen and smugglers along the routes.

“The information discovered in this investigation, as well as in the investigations of additional Hamas terror operatives recently arrested, reveals another small part of the many efforts by Hamas to advance its violent terror actions,” said a statement by the Shin Bet. “This time, the Hamas efforts exploit the fact that Israel has eased the restrictions on the Gaza fishermen.”
PCG, BFAR arrests 18 Viet fishermen for illegal fishing in PHL waters

PCG: 18 Vietnamese fishermen were apprehended in three separate patrols by the Philippine Coast Guard from May 10 to12 in a joint Monitoring, Control and Surveillance (MCS) mission in Sta. Ana, Cagayan.

The first incident involved seven fishermen onboard Vietnamese Bulit Fishing Boat (VFB) with bow markings BD95702TS.



The patrol team onboard MCS-3007 and MCS-3010 found the VFB surrounded by cast lines and bouys northwest of Calayan waters. The Viet fishing boat immediately escaped the area but was chased by the Coast Guard onboard a rubber boat.

Upon apprehension, the patrol team inspected the boat and directed its crew to sail to Port Irene, Sta. Ana, Cagayan for the filing of proper charges



Two days later, six Vietnamese fishermen were arrested at the vicinity waters of Wyllie Rocks in Panuitan Island, Cagayan while five more were taken into custody off Catanapan Point, Cagayan for similar violations.



The three Vietnamese fishing vessels, upon arrival in Port Irene, Sta. Ana, Cagayan, were inspected by the Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources-Quick Response Team (BFAR QRT) RO2 and were charged for the violation of Sec 91 (Poaching) of RA 10654 otherwise known as the “Philippine Fisheries Code of 1998”.
MANILA (Reuters) - Philippine fishing authorities said on Tuesday they had detained 25 Chinese crew of two seized fishing boats on suspicion of poaching, a move that could further strain ties between two countries at odds over maritime sovereignty.

A joint team from the Philippine coastguard and the Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources (BFAR) captured the Chinese vessels on Monday sailing without permits between waters off Babuyan Island and Batanes province in the northern Philippines.

The Chinese vessels were in waters that are not part of the disputed South China Sea, which China claims almost entirely. Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, Vietnam and Taiwan also have conflicting claims.

Tension between the Philippines and China has risen as an international tribunal in the Hague prepares to deliver a ruling in the next few months in a case lodged by Manila in 2013.

The Philippines is seeking a clarification of United Nations maritime laws that could undermine China’s claims to 90 percent of the South China Sea. China has rejected the court’s authority.

The fishing boats were flying an inverted Philippine flag when apprehended on Monday, BFAR said in a statement.

Speaking at a regular press briefing in Beijing, China’s Foreign Ministry spokesman Hong Lei said he had no information and needed to further understand the situation.

Documents seized by Philippine authorities showed the vessels were Chinese registered. The fishermen failed to show permits required to enter Philippine waters, BFAR said.

“Based on existing rules, the fact that both foreign fishing vessels were flying a Philippine flag gave rise to the presumption that they are engaged in poaching,” said BFAR director, Asis Perez.

A Philippine court fined nine Chinese fishermen $102,000 each in late 2014 after they were caught with hundreds of sea turtles in the disputed Half Moon Shoal in the Spratly islands of the South China Sea.

At the time, China protested against the arrests and refused to recognize their trial.

SAN FELIPE, Yucatan– Once again violence arises in the area of Rio Lagartos and San Felipe, when local fishermen from these shores found other fishermen capturing sea cucumber during the ban, which caused a confrontation resulting in one dead person and several boats burned.

On Friday May 13, fishermen of San Felipe and Rio Lagartos went out to sea and near “Las Coloradas”, encountered three boats illegally catching the product.

A dispute took place, in which one of the fishermen fell from a boat and got seriously injured with the propeller.

Boats and poachers were returned to the beach, in an area known as “Cancuncito”, and the injured man was taken to San Carlos Hospital in Tizimín, where he was officially pronounced dead hours later.

Protesting fishermen burned boats because the authorities have not agreed to grant permits for the capture of this highly priced echinoderm, plus they congregated at the gates of the Palacio Municipal of San Felipe and blocked the entrances to the building.

After these clashes between fishermen catching sea cucumber on the coast of Yucatan last weekend, that left one dead, the State Secretary General of Government, Roberto Rodriguez Asaf, told SIPSE that “one of the possible solutions [to violence ] would be to grant permissions to fish sea cucumber” but this would have to be analyzed by the proper authorities from the National Commission of Aquaculture and Fisheries (Conapesca) and the National Fisheries Institute (Inapesca).

Then, the official said that security has been strengthened along the coast of Yucatan to prevent more violence.

He said the Navy of Mexico, the Ministry of Public Security Yucatan (SSP), the Mexican Army and the Federal Police have tightened security both on land and at sea.

Meanwhile, PAN deputy, Joaquín Jesús Diaz Mena, accused the state government of being responsible for the wave of violence in the coastal towns. In an interview with Diario Excelsior, he stated that the incidents are caused by the government and reflect the incompetence of officials and employees of the state administration to control this situation.

“This is an extremely serious conflict for the fisheries sector in the area of Dzilam Bravo, San Felipe, Rio Lagartos and El Cuyo, caused by the irresponsibility of the Government of Rolando Zapata Bello, to ensure the security of its inhabitants”.

Sea cucumbers are echinoderms—like starfish and sea urchins. There are some 1,250 known species, and many of these animals are indeed shaped like soft-bodied cucumbers. All sea cucumbers are ocean dwellers, though some inhabit the shallows and others live in the deep ocean. They live on or near the ocean floor—sometimes partially buried beneath it.

Sea cucumbers feed on tiny particles like algae, minute aquatic animals, or waste materials, they break down these particles into even smaller pieces, which become fodder for bacteria, and thus recycle them back into the ocean ecosystem. Their function is vital for the balance of the ocean’s wildlife, and the government cannot just grant permits for fishermen to catch these species without control.

(CNN) Jonathan Garcia Pereda snapped a photo, the contraband glowing white in his smartphone. Mexican federal police had stopped a 28-year-old man from San Felipe at a checkpoint, discovering black plastic bags balled up in the tires. It appeared to be another familiar bust to the Mexican police, until they cut open the bags.

One hundred twenty-one fish swim bladders lay before Garcia Pereda on the concrete floor, most of them white, some with shades of pink. The smell of fish guts was overwhelming, a stench Garcia Pereda never grew accustomed to, even as he went from bust after bust of the illegal smuggling. This was a huge haul of "aquatic cocaine": 39 kilos of totoaba fish swim bladders, with a Hong Kong street value of $750,000. Not quite as big as a recent bust, thought Garcia Pereda, where they'd stopped 600 bladders from getting across the U.S.-Mexico border, flowing eventually to China.

These swim bladders were large, all from totoaba bass at least 30 years old. Garcia Pereda, a representative from PROFEPA, Mexico's version of the Environmental Protection Agency, knew this bust was barely a dent in the multibillion-dollar international black market, robbing Mexico of its endangered species.

Garcia Pereda leaned down to snap another picture, wondering how Chinese buyers could pay so much for an irrelevant part of a fish. Most of all, he wondered even with all the efforts by the Mexican government, the Mexican navy and international environmental activists, if they could stop a seemingly insatiable and bizarre appetite for the dying species' bladder.

The market

"It's the best of the best. It makes one more beautiful," the shop owner said in Mandarin, holding up a picture of dried totoaba bladder. "You can oil it or put it in a stew," he continued. The middle-age seafood shop owner pointed to the picture and said it would cost about $100,000 U.S.

The totoaba's swim bladder is the priciest dried fish item in Sheung Wan, a neighborhood in Hong Kong. In a cluster of shops on a street commonly known to tourists and locals as Dried Seafood Street, exotic dried fare sit in giant tubs and glass jars, promising a variety of cures to a number of health ailments.

Shops have entire sections displaying dozens of types of fish bladders, ranging from $100 U.S. to thousands of dollars. Chinese culture has long believed fish bladder is rich in collagen, improving skin texture and maintaining youthful-looking skin.

The totoaba fish bladder is distinguished by two tentacles.

Few items are as desired as the totoaba bladder, what one shopkeeper called the "Mercedes-Benz" of dried fish, referring to its cost. The high price comes from the tototaba's scarcity. It exists only in the most northernmost section of the Sea of Cortez in Mexico, in a quiet reserve called the Gulf of California. The totoaba is the only fish bladder on the market that has two unusual-looking tentacles that stretch the length of the bladder, giving it a unique and otherworldly appearance.

The totoaba is also endangered, placed on international endangered species lists since the 1970s. Commercial fishing first took its toll on the species, and now a new threat ravages the remaining fish: Chinese demand.

Hong Kong bans the sale of totoaba, because it's an endangered species. Perhaps the Hong Kong shop owner holding the picture was thinking of the law: Two weeks ago, he said he could sell totoaba. But on this second visit, he quoted the $100,000 price and urged us to shop elsewhere.

At another store, a merchant pledged totoaba will help ease achy joints and soft tissues. The recommended way to ingest it? "Soup." The only way to buy it? A lot of money.

The fish bladders are smuggled through North America toward Asia.

The source

The Russian-made helicopter lifted off the ground of the Mexican naval base at San Felipe, a fishing village in Mexico's Baja California. Aboard the helicopter were nearly a dozen sailors, some armed with semiautomatic rifles. The chopper made its way from dusty flatlands to the pristine blue waters of the Sea of Cortez. Just a few clicks north of San Felipe, the Colorado River meets the Gulf of California, where freshwater flows into the sea.

Helicopters are used to spot evidence of smugglers in the Gulf of California.

It's here, 5,019 square miles of the gulf, that is home to the totoaba's nursery and spawning habitat. The Mexican military flies twice a day over this nursery, patrolling for poachers. Mexico's government declared this area and 400 miles of coastline a protected habitat and off-limits to all fishing.

But money is a more potent draw than the fear of arrest, with poachers making as much money from the bladders as they do from cocaine. That pound for pound profit is why observers dub the totoaba bladder "aquatic cocaine."

Shortly after taking off, the pilot spots a giant net in the protected coastline. It's is an illegal totoaba net, hidden until poachers can drop the 2 kilometer-long net in the gulf to trap totoaba.

Nine sailors, heaving and sweating, pull the heavy net aboard the chopper. The captain of the mission lifts a corner of the net. "The holes are 12 inches wide," he said. "It's used specifically to fish totoaba illegally. The head gets stuck, and it suffocates. It's dangerous to the totoaba, but it's also the main killer of the vaquita."

A totoaba that died caught in a smuggler's net.

The vaquita is another, more critically endangered marine animal. It looks like a small dolphin, its mouth curling up in a semi-permanent smile. Like for the totoaba, the Gulf of California is its breeding ground and nursery. And like the totoaba, this gulf is the only place in the world where it exists. It also has the extreme misfortune of being the same size as the totoaba: Its head fits perfectly in the illegal nets. The vaquita has no financial value to the poachers, but as by-catch, it is now on the verge of extinction.

On April 13, NOAA Fisheries, along with an international group of scientists, released a report to Mexico's minister of the environment and natural resources saying that only 60 vaquitas remain in the Gulf of California. The scientists say that number represents a decline of more than 92% since 1997. At this pace, the report says, the vaquita species will be extinct in five years.

The scientists urged Mexico's government to continue with direct action against the poachers so both the totoaba and vaquita survive. It is a call, for now, that the government is hearing.

In the air, the navy has one airplane and one helicopter launching twice a day.

On the ground, six drug-sniffing dogs, once trained to locate cocaine, now sit at three checkpoints leading out of the protected area, inspecting 250 cars and 300 people a day.

On the water, six boats and a larger naval vessel patrol the protected area of the Gulf of California, both at day and at night, when poachers are most active. All this is part of a national effort costing the government millions of dollars.

The effort may seem massive, but the lure of the black market carries a financial potency that's proving difficult to stop.

The fishermen

Jorge Garcia sat on the back of his truck, selling fish filets and shrimp to tourists wandering the boardwalk in San Felipe. He looked out at the water, disgusted that his two boats are not doing what Garcia was raised to do: fish big game like totoaba.

"We're being punished," he said. "Young fishermen from out of town are coming in, fishing illegally in the water, making tons of money."

Garcia, his skin tanned, thickened and coarsely lined from decades on fishing boats, motioned to himself sitting on the truck. "But I can't fish."

Garica said he's participating in a government program that is paying him to not fish in the protected vaquita and totoaba sanctuary. The government promised him $3,100 U.S. a month, but he says the actual payout was closer to $2,000 U.S. One totoaba bladder, Garcia reminded us, would be double the government's monthly incentive to not fish.

"I understand what the government is doing," said Garica. "But they're not stopping it. The illegal fishing happens at night. There's too much money involved."

The fish bladders are thought to promote health and beauty when eaten.

Garcia was baffled when he learned the swim bladders were being used as an anti-aging product in Hong Kong, eaten as a soup. Garcia, who grew up eating totoaba, said, "If it really worked for beauty, I should be beautiful by now. Instead, look at me."

The Mexican government knows it has an uphill climb stopping the illegal fishing.

PROFEPA's Garcia Pereda, having been a part of numerous totoaba busts, watched as the sailors pulled up an illegal net in the vaquita and totoaba sanctuary. The naval officer told Garcia Pereda they're still pulling up nine nets a day. Trapped in this net was a totoaba, probably 20 years old. It had not been dead long; its swim bladder was still intact.

"We watch this place 24 hours a day, and it's sad to see that this still happens despite all our efforts," he said.

The fishermen pull the bladders, roll them into small packages and move them north. "Like ants," Garcia Pereda said. "They move them in small quantities, bit by bit. They're smuggled. They're put on commercial flights and commercial shipping companies where they make their way into Shanghai, Hong Kong, often through the United States or Japan."

A San Felipe fisherman has no ties to China, that's clear, said Garcia Pereda. But he wouldn't detail whether the transnational crime originates with the Mexican cartels. "It's obvious that to get this product abroad, we're dealing with some sort of organized groups. We just can't say if it's specifically organized crime."

Garcia Pereda knows from his experience in the Mexican government that there's one rule in dealing with illegal contraband: "If there's a market for it, there will always be those who will disobey the law."

"Ready, go!" Dan Villa, his arms stretched straight above his head, released his grip on the drone against the night sky.

"Heading to the target," said Roy Sasano, flying the drone out a mile and a half from the Sea Shepherd vessel.

"Anything yet?" quizzed Villa, peering over Sasano's shoulder at the night-vision camera from the drone. Water stretched from either side of the camera's frame. Villa is the campaign leader of Operation Milagro, Spanish for "miracle," the latest mission for environmental activist group Sea Shepherd.

The Sea Shepherd is an environmental group's ship fighting fish bladder smuggling.

Sea Shepherd is best known globally for its direct action against Japan's whaling in the Antarctic, engaging the whaling fleet boldly at sea. It's a level of direct confrontation rarely seen on the environmental activist stage, but just one of the group's many campaigns around the world.

In the Gulf of California, Sea Shepherd is working in conjunction with the Mexican government to halt the poaching, often calling the navy for help in arresting poachers or pulling up giant nets.

Dan Villa aboard the Sea Shepherd.

"We see pangas here," Villa said, referring to the boats the fishermen use. "They cast their nets illegally where there's no fishing. We motor towards them, and since they're doing illegal activities, they always flee." The crew aboard the Sea Shepherd vessel, dubbed the Farley Mowat, marks the spot where the drone spots the fishermen and return at daybreak to retrieve any net left behind.

"I see something," said Sasano, the drone getting closer to the target.

Sasano, a former member of the Canadian navy, slowed the drone. Get too close, and the fishermen bolt before the drone's camera can capture and record what they're doing.

The fishermen spot the drone, appear to drop something over the side of the boat and speed off.

The crew marked the location and continued the dark hunt. The team spotted six more illegal fishing boats, all which zoomed away.

"I think it's a fight," said Katja Walther, a deckhand on the vessel. "I think it's a battle that we're fighting. It's just one of those lies that people consume. We're seeing a decline of species here and it's tragic."

Biologist Benjamin Sawicki, also a Sea Shepherd crew member, is one of the few humans who has seen a vaquita. He was perched on the top of the Farley Mowat when he saw a vaquita's dorsal fin slowly surface.

"They're so few of them, people's attitudes now locally and sometimes in the conservation world are that there are not enough animals worth saving. We're not looking at just protecting the vaquita or the totoaba. If the whole system doesn't work, we're a part of the whole system. Eventually it affects us as well."

The reality of the poaching for the Sea Shepherd crew is palpable when they spot a frequent sight: dead totoaba floating. The Farley Mowat crew pulled up a partially decomposed totoaba. It had been cut open.

"On the inside here right behind near the spine is its swim bladder," said crew member Adam Conniss. "You can see there's no swim bladder." Poachers tossed the carcass back into the sea, the fish without any value after the removal of the swim bladder.

It's quietly infuriating to Villa, who has been with Sea Shepherd for more than 10 years, on campaigns around the world.

CAPE TOWN (Reuters) - South Africa’s navy has detained three Chinese ships with around 100 crew on board on suspicion of illegal squid fishing, officials said on Monday.

The ships were spotted on Friday having entered South Africa’s 200 nautical mile economic exclusion zone without permits. When South African officials asked the ships to sail to port they attempted to flee but were eventually captured.

“We cannot tolerate the plundering of our marine resources, which are a source of food security,” Agriculture and Fisheries Minister Senzeni Zokwana said in a statement.

“We are also looking into the sudden influx of these vessels in our waters.”

The three vessels - Fu Yuan Yu 7880, Fu Yang Yu 7881 and Run Da 617 - had a combined total of almost 600 tonnes of squid when the navy escorted them to shore. Inspectors found all three ships had no permits to fish locally.

Crew members have been detained on the ships. Captains face fines and possible jail sentences if found guilty.

Globally, illegal fishing costs the industry around $23 billion each year, with one in four fish thought to be caught illegally in African waters.

In October, a Sao Tome and Principe court won a key victory against illegal fishing by organised syndicates when it convicted the captain of a vessel and two crew members on a number of charges, Interpol official said.
FREETOWN (Reuters) - Sierra Leone was holding 11 Guineans including military personnel in custody on Wednesday following a confrontation at sea involving the two West African neighbors’ navies, Sierra Leonean officials said.

The incident occurred early on Monday morning off the coast of northern Sierra Leone near the countries’ border, the officials said.

Vessels from the two countries exchanged gunfire after Guinean naval forces illegally boarded a Chinese fishing vessel in Sierra Leonean waters, said Al Shek Kamara, Head of Operations for the Sierra Leone Police.

He said the Guineans had been holding the vessel’s crew at gunpoint demanding money.

Guinea rejected that version of events.

“There was a Chinese boat that was being pursued by the Guinean navy and entered into Sierra Leone’s territory. During the maneuver, the Guinean navy entered into Sierra Leone’s territory,” said government spokesman Damantang Albert Camara.

He said the Guinean personnel had disembarked to carry out administrative formalities and would return home soon.

“There was no gunfire or arrests,” Camara said.

West Africa, home to some of the world’s richest fishing waters, loses up to $1.5 billion worth of fish each year to vessels fishing in protected zones or without proper equipment or licenses.

Under-equipped West African maritime forces are struggling to clamp down on illegal foreign vessels, many of them Chinese.

One fifth of China’s distant water fishing fleet now operates in Africa, Greenpeace said in a report published last year. Beijing rejected the accusation.
More than a dozen foreign nationals are facing charges over one of Western Australia's biggest drug seizures, linked to a suspicious boat that was intercepted off Geraldton in the Mid West.

It comes after 216kg of crystal methamphetamine was seized from two properties in suburban Perth — the equivalent of two million individual hits on the streets with a value of around $200 million, according to police.

The boat was inspected for several days after being escorted into Geraldton. ( ABC News: Chris Lewis )

WA Police deputy commissioner Gary Dreibergs said 14 people, eight Chinese nationals and six Malay nationals, would be charged over "the biggest methamphetamine seizure in WA this year".

It is alleged the Chinese nationals, aged between 37 and 56, used the fishing trawler to transport the drugs from China to WA, before using a runabout to drop them on a remote part of the coast four weeks ago.

Police said further investigations led them to raid homes across Perth and arrest six Malaysian men, aged between 24 and 54.

More than 150kg of methamphetamines was seized from a house in East Cannington, and a further 50kg from a house in Embleton.

Deputy commissioner Dreibergs said the syndicate had continued to operate in Perth despite knowing police had swooped on the trawler and impounded it.

"They certainly are brazen and they certainly are committed," he said.

"It is evident that this seizure is part of a well-funded, highly-organised, sophisticated overseas criminal organisation.

"Without the outstanding joint work of all Australian law enforcement agencies, this result would not have been achieved."

Haul follows long-running investigation

The investigation into the alleged drug smuggling operation started when the trawler was intercepted about 185 kilometres off the coast earlier this month and escorted to the Geraldton Fishermen's Wharf, 400 kilometres north of Perth.

Firefighters donned protective gear to remove items from the boat. ( ABC Open: Chris Lewis )

The vessel was inspected for several days as firefighters wearing protective gear removed containers suspected to have been used to hold chemicals.

Eight Chinese crew were later taken into immigration detention by the Australian Federal Police (AFP) as they "did not have valid visas to enter Australia".

The operation involved officers from WA Police, the AFP and Australian Border Force.

AFP commissioner David Stewart could not say if any of those arrested were key players in the alleged syndicate.

"We'll certainly allege that we have disrupted and dismantled a significant organised crime network," he said.

"It's very sophisticated because there are different elements of that group that we will be alleging participated in the importation of these narcotics."

Police said two of the men arrested over the haul were in WA on tourist visas.

The details of the case and those charged had been the subject of strict suppression orders issued by the Perth Magistrates Court in closed hearings over the past few days.

MANILA (Reuters) - Two Philippine coast guard vessels intercepted a Chinese fishing boat with 10 crew off northeastern Luzon after a two-hour chase, two local broadcasters said on Friday, accusing them encroaching into Philippine territorial waters.

It was the latest in a series of similar clashes, with each side saying the other is in the wrong.

China and the Philippines are locked in a territorial dispute in the South China Sea, a strategic waterway where $5 trillion worth of ship-borne trade passes every year. Brunei, Malaysia, Taiwan and Vietnam also have claims.

Lieutenant Jeffrey Collado told broadcasters ABS-CBN and GMA the steel-hulled Chinese fishing boat, flying a Philippine flag, tried to escape after ramming the Coast Guard boat but another vessel arrived to help stop the Chinese boat.

“The Chinese fishing boat was in Philippine territorial waters, they are not in disputed seas,” he said, adding the 10 fishermen would be charged with illegal fishing.

Tension between the Philippines and China has risen as an international tribunal in the Hague prepares to deliver a ruling in the next few months in a case lodged by Manila in 2013.

The Philippines is seeking a clarification of United Nations maritime laws that could undermine China’s claims to 90 percent of the South China Sea. China has rejected the court’s authority.
The captain of fishing vessel Gui Bei Yu 27088 has admitted to having repeatedly entered Indonesia for poaching before being caught by the Indonesian Navy last week.

Ziang Tuang Chean said he was aware that he had been operating in Indonesia’s exclusive economic zone ( EEZ ) in the South China Sea, and that he was forced to fish there because it was among the few remaining places that still held an enormous amount of fishery resources.

"It was my third time fishing in the area before being caught by the Indonesian Navy," said Ziang through his interpreter on Thursday.

"I am aware that I had operated in Indonesian waters. There are still many fish there compared to other places," he said, adding that it took him around a week to arrive in Natuna from Guangxi, China.

The Navy seized the vessel and arrested its eight crew members on May 27 after it entered the resource-rich Natuna area off the northwest coast of Kalimantan for alleged poaching.



The Navy said the arrests should serve as a warning to the world that the Indonesian military would not tolerate any breach of Indonesian sovereignty by foreign vessels.



Ziang and his crew are currently detained in a cell at a naval command base in Ranai, Riau Islands.

"We were forced to detain them because they resisted arrest, and we're afraid they may cause nuisance," said Ranai Navy commander Col. Arif Badrudin.

Only the captain, chief mechanic and fishmaster will face prosecution for the violations while the remaining crew will be sent home. (dmr)

£160 million worth of heroin was recovered in Indian Ocean

More than a tonne of heroin worth an astonishing £160 million was seized in the Indian Ocean in a successful drugs bust led by the Royal Navy.

Operation Shirikisho targeted four fishing boats heading to East Africa and stopped the high-grade drug reaching the continent and then Europe.

Boats and helicopters were deployed during the operation and both the French and Australian Navy were heavily involved in the seizure.

Uk-led Operation Shirikisho targeted four fishing boats and stopped the drug reaching Africa and then Europe

After the illicit cargo was recovered it was lined up on a warship - as these astonishing photographs show - before it was taken away to be destroyed.

Commander of combined task force, Commodore Guy Robinson said: 'This has been a highly successful operation to prevent a very significant amount of heroin from reaching the shores of Europe.

'It is also an excellent example of the impressive co-operation across CMF contributing-nations, at sea, in the air and ashore. We will continue to tackle this menace whenever, and wherever we can.'

The first haul of narcotics was made by the Royal Australian Navy when HMAS Darwin's boarding team targeted a fishing dhow in May.

Following an eight-and-a-half hour search, the team uncovered 380kg of heroin, packed in bags.

Then 12 hours later, the same crew boarded another suspect dhow and found a further 512kg of drugs. A third suspect dhow was later boarded and another 60kg was discovered.

Commodore Guy Robinson said the operation highlighted the co-operation across CMF contributing-nations

A few days later a French Marine Nationale ship patrolling off the coast of East Africa sent a boarding team to search another vessel and 130kg of heroin was recovered.

UK-led CTF 150 is part of Combined Maritime Forces, a multi-national naval partnership, which covers 3.2 million square miles of the Indian Ocean, Red Sea, and the Gulf region.

Captain John Craig, the Deputy Commander of CTF 150, said: 'In addition to the successful seizure of such a large amount of drugs, operations like Shirikisho help us refine our tactical skills as we coordinate extensive air searches over enormous areas of ocean to locate traffickers in very small dhows.

'The opportunity to work with French and Australian ships and aircraft also improves our collective understanding of each other's operating capabilities, to make sure that we are as prepared as we can be for operations in the future.

'Multi-national co-operation has been vital to the success of the operation.'

The Ministry of Maritime Affairs and Fisheries has apprehended seven boats sailing under Vietnamese flag for alleged illegal fishing in Indonesian waters.

“Our Orca 003 patrol vessel escorted seven boats from Vietnam, along with 55 Vietnamese crew members, to the ministry’s Natuna task force on the island of Riau on June 12,” said the secretary to the ministry’s directorate general for maritime and fisheries resources supervision, Waluyo Sejati Abutohir, as quoted by the Antara news agency on Monday.

Waluyo said the seven boats consisted of six vessels of gross tonnage below 100 and one with gross tonnage below 60. Those boats were reportedly used for fishing in Natuna waters on the morning of June 10 with illegal pair trawl equipment. The crew members allegedly failed to present permits for fishing in Indonesian waters.

The crew members faces charges under Article 93 of the 2004 law on fisheries, which carries a maximum sentence of six years in prison and a fine of Rp20 billion (US$1.5 million). (dmr)
Officers find 448kg of the drug and arrest two men after becoming suspicious of an abandoned boat in Northland

Police have seized a 448kg haul of methamphetamine in New Zealand’s Northland, in what they say is “without a doubt” the country’s largest-ever bust.

Officers found the drugs - estimated to be worth $NZ448m (£222m) on the street - after becoming suspicious of an abandoned boat at 90 Mile Beach and hearing reports of two men driving around over the past two weeks offering locals large amounts of cash to help launch vessels off the beach.

As police were checking the runabout on Sunday, a Toyota Prado they were looking for drove by, prompting a brief chase that ended at the nearby Ahipara Golf Course.

Two Auckland men, aged 31 and 26, were arrested before a police officer on his way home spotted another wanted vehicle, a campervan, driving around in Totara North, prompting the arrest of a third man, aged 19.

In the van they found suitcases and bags containing dozens of zip-lock bags full of methamphetamine, totalling 448kg.

“This is without a doubt, the largest ever seizure of methamphetamine in New Zealand,” Northland district commander superintendent Russell Le Prou said in a statement.

“What is so great about this is that its not only the result of hard work by the Northland police, but its the result of information we got from the community.”

There were 15 suitcase-sized bags, each with up to 30kg of methamphetamine – which is known as “P” in New Zealand – inside, which Le Prou likened to drug hauls depicted in movies.

The bags had salt water on them.

“You may infer from that that it’s possibly been left out at sea for a while and picked up by that smaller boat,” Le Prou told RNZ.

“If New Zealand was the ultimate destination, I would say 448kg would have made a significant impact on New Zealand... that level of harm we can’t tolerate.”

Police say the single seizure easily outstrips all the methamphetamine seized in 2015 - when 334kg was grabbed.

Customs is working with police on the case as they try to determine where the drugs came from and if anyone else was involved.

All three men are expected to appear in Kaitaia District Court on Tuesday morning facing charges of importing class A drugs and Possession for supply.
GEORGE TOWN: Six Indonesian crew members on board a vessel were caught fishing illegally in Malaysian waters.

A patrol team from the Malaysian Maritime Enforcement Agency (MMEA) spotted the vessel some 48 nautical miles south-west of Pulau Kendi at about 5pm on Monday.

The crew, aged between 22 and 26, and the vessel were brought back to the Batu Maung jetty.

MMEA Maritime 2 district director First Admiral Kamaruszaman Abu Hassan said they spotted the vessel without registration number during Ops Khas Satria Utara.

He said the skipper and his crew members failed to produce valid documents and permit to fish in Malaysian waters.

“According to the skipper, they came to our waters because of better catch in view of the coming festive season,” he said in a statement.

The boat was impounded, together with the fishing equipment and about 50kg of fish.

Kamaruszaman said the fishermen would be investigated under Section 15 (1)(a) of the Fisheries Act 1985 for fishing in Malaysian waters without permission.

If convicted, they could face up to RM100,000 fine each while the skipper up to RM1mil.

He said the agency also carried out operation codenamed Ops Pagar Laut during Ramadan to prevent smuggling activities and encroachment by illegal foreigners via seawaters.
June 27, 2016

Royal Australian Navy patrol boat HMAS Wollongong helped seize two foreign fishing vessels, believed to be Vietnamese, in waters off far North Queensland for suspected illegal fishing.

Maritime Border Command within the Australian Border Force, made the apprehensions on June 21 near Dianne Bank in a coordinated effort with the Australian Fisheries Management Authority.

During the inspection, officers found diving gear to support multiple teams of divers, approximately 8.7 tonnes of bêche-de-mer, a quantity of turtle meat, and coral and reef fish suspected to have been caught illegally.

According to the Australian Navy, twenty-six crew members believed to be Vietnamese nationals have been detained and were escorted to Cairns, where further investigations will be undertaken by Fisheries Management staff.

General Manager Fisheries Operations, Peter Venslovas, said as regional governments crack down on illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing, Australia’s well-managed fisheries become enticing for illegal foreign fishing.

“Australia’s fisheries are some of the best managed in the world and illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing undermines both the economic and environmental sustainability of our marine resources,” Venslovas said.

These latest apprehensions follow two Vietnamese vessels and 30 crew apprehended at the beginning of the month for suspected illegal fishing on Lihou Reef in the coral sea, and convictions in May of four Indonesian fishers for illegally fishing for shark fin in Australia’s northern waters.
Coast Guard officials nabbed 2.5 tons of illegal sailfish off the coast of Caldera, Puntarenas Wednesday afternoon, marking the largest ever confiscation of sailfish here.

According to the Public Security Ministry, the fish came off a tuna boat with a Nicaraguan flag anchored off the shore of Caldera in the Gulf of Nicoya. They were then transferred a Costa Rican boat, transferred to shore and loaded into a seafood truck.

Officials said the catch was confiscated because it was unloaded in unsanitary conditions and at an unauthorized location. Also, the catch itself wasn’t authorized and sailfish is generally reserved for catch and release sport fishing in Costa Rica.

The Puntarenas Prosecutor’s Office ordered Coast Guard officials to impound the tuna boat.
KUALA TERENGGANU, June 30 — The Malaysian Maritime Enforcement Agency (MMEA) foiled an attempt to smuggle out RM700,000 worth of diesel in the country’s waters on Wednesday, following the arrest of 10 foreigners.

Kemaman Maritime Base commander Lt Com Mohd Marmizi Mohd Noor said the suspects aged between 16 and 50 were arrested about 136 to 138 nautical miles off the Kemaman Exclusive Economic Zone.

He said the agency also seized 250,000 litres of diesel found on the two boats operated by the suspects.

“When conducting a routine patrol, we detected two suspicious foreign fishing boats which were anchored... the boats were using the Malaysian flag to mislead the authorities,” he said in a statement here, today.

He added that the suspects comprising eight Thai, and two Cambodian nationals, were believed to be waiting for more smuggled fuel from local fishermen and suppliers.

Marmizi said all the suspects were not carrying any personal identification documents, and there was no permit to operate the boat in the waters for the purpose.

He said based on the quantity of diesel found, the police did not rule out the possibility that one of the boats had been in the waters for about two weeks.

He said the boats which were registered in Thailand had also modified their fuel tanks to facilitate the illegal activity, and the diesel was believed to be marketed to neighbouring countries due to the high demand.

All the suspects have been remanded for 14 days for further investigations. — Bernama

Colombo, Jul 7 (PTI) Sri Lankan Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe today expressed hope that the fishermen issue with India would be resolved as talks were going on at different levels, even as more than 40 Indian fishermen have been arrested by Lankan Navy this month.

Chief Opposition Whip Anura Kumara Dissanayake asked the Prime Minister if moves were underway to allow fishing by Indian trawlers limited to a number of days per week or by a restricted zone in the north eastern seas.

Wickremesinghe, while answering an opposition query in the parliament, said that around 1,000 Indian trawlers were illegally fishing in the countrys waters using bottom trawling techniques which is very harmful to the fishing resource.

"We have received various proposals to end this dispute. The main objective is to put a stop to bottom trawling. We cannot allow our fishing resources to be plundered. At the moment there are around 130-140 boats in our custody. We may return the fishermen but we cant release their boats.

"We will seek the views of the northern fishermen as to how we could resolve this issue. We cant be seen to be doing anything against their wishes," Wickremesinghe said.

Foreign Ministers of India and Sri Lanka had discussed the issue while the Navies of the two countries have also tried to resolve the issue through their periodical talks. The Joint Commission meeting between the two countries was also to take up this issue as a priority, Wickremesinghe said, adding that talks were going on at different levels.

Dissanayake was unhappy with the Prime Ministers explanation that family ties between the two countries among the people in the area had led to this issue. He was citing the restrictions placed by India to curb the Pakistani illegal fishing on the Indian side of the waters and demanding such action from the Sri Lankan government vis a vis India.

Sixteen Tamil Nadu fishermen were arrested by Sri Lankan naval personnel yesterday when they were fishing near Katchatheevu, the fourth such incident this week. With this, the number of fishermen arrested for allegedly fishing in Lankan territorial waters have gone up to 44 since July 3.

On July 5, 17 fishermen from Nagapattinam were arrested for allegedly fishing in Lankan territorial waters, while six fishermen from Pamban in Ramanathapuram district were arrested the previous day. Five fishermen were arrested on Sunday. PTI CORR CPS AKJ CPS

HANOI, July 12 — Vietnam has accused the Chinese coastguard of sinking a fishing boat near a disputed island chain, authorities said today, ahead of key UN-backed ruling on claims in the flashpoint South China Sea.

Two Vietnamese boats were chased by a pair of Chinese coastguard ships on Saturday afternoon off Vietnam’s Quang Ngai province, the Vietnam Fisheries Society (Vinafis) said in a statement.

One ship was boarded by Chinese coastguards who forced the crew overboard, Vinafis said, while a second vessel was prevented from reaching the stranded fishermen.

“Chinese men jumped onto fisherman Vo Van Luu’s boat, struck the Vietnamese sailors and... sunk the vessel,” forcing five crew members overboard, the statement said.

The five fishermen remained in the sea until dark, when the second Vietnamese vessel was able to approach the area.

Vinafis “condemned” the incident and demanded compensation from China.

There was no immediate comment from China on the allegations.

Beijing lays claim to virtually all of the South China Sea, putting it at odds with regional neighbours the Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei and Taiwan, which also have partial claims.

Later today, the UN-backed Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA) in The Hague is set to rule on the legality of China’s claims to an area of the sea contested by the Philippines.

It is a much anticipated court ruling with analysts saying a verdict that goes against Beijing could see a spike in aggressive actions in the area.

Vietnam and China frequently trade diplomatic barbs over the disputed Paracel island chain and waters in the South China Sea.

China is encouraging patriotic tourists to visit the contested Paracels, which are known as Xisha in Chinese.

Such acts have deepened already simmering anti-Chinese sentiment in Vietnam.

At least three Chinese people were killed in 2014 when rioting broke out in Vietnam after Beijing sent an oil rig into contested waters. — AFP

Three Vietnamese Die in Border Violence

An outbreak of violence between Cambodian officials and Vietnamese nationals near the Cambodia-Vietnam border claimed three lives and resulted in multiple injuries on the weekend.



On Friday, two Vietnamese nationals died in a firefight between Vietnamese and Cambodian fishermen that left three others injured, including a Cambodian police officer, in Takeo province’s Bourei Cholsar district.



Provincial police said the cause of the violence was illegal fishing by the Vietnamese.



Provincial internal security police chief Chhun Sareth said one of the Vietnamese nationals died at the scene of the shooting, while another died in a hospital from his injuries. Two other Vietnamese nationals were injured in the gunfire, while the third non-fatal casualty was a Cambodian police officer.



Mr. Sareth deferred further questions to the fishery police and provincial military border police.



“For more details on this case, go to the fishery police and district border military police. However, the latest information about this case is one more Vietnamese national died at the hospital,” he said, referring to the second Vietnamese fatality.



Bourei Cholsar district fisheries police officer Lang Sopheap said he was working on the case, but had not received any additional information from Vietnamese authorities.



“The case is in progress and I cannot give more details,” he said.



Elsewhere, a Cambodian deputy border police officer stationed at Takeo’s Phnom Den border with Vietnam’s An Giang province was arrested on Saturday after allegedly opening fire on two Vietnamese men, killing one and seriously injuring the other.



The suspect, Lay Bunthy, was arrested by An Giang provincial authorities on the Vietnamese side of the border immediately after shooting the two men at a beer garden in An Giang’s Tinh Bien district.



A local news outlet identified the weapon used by Mr. Bunthy as a K59 pistol. The Cambodian officer apparently fired three rounds at the two victims, killing a 33-year-old man and seriously injuring a 34-year-old man.



Mr. Bunthy is now in Tinh Bien police custody awaiting further legal procedures.

KUALA TERENGGANU: The state Malaysian Maritime Enforcement Agency (MMEA) has detained 88 Vietnamese crew members and seized eight fishing vessels over a three-day operation to thwart illegal intrusion in Malaysian waters.

Terengganu MMEA enforcement chief Maritime Captain Zainolabidin Jusoh said those nabbed were aged between 19 and 63 while the catch of fish and squid worth RM53,700 were also seized.

He said the eight fishing vessels and the equipment seized were worth about RM2.7mil.

“The first raid, on Friday, occurred about 45 nautical miles off Kuala Terengganu, between 6am and 9am, when four C2 class vessels with 43 Vietnamese crew and the skipper were detained,” he told a press conference at the MMEA office here on Monday.

At about 9pm, the next day, two more vessels with 18 more Vietnamese crew members and the skipper were detained about 44 nautical miles off Kuala Terengganu,” said Capt Zainolabidin.

“Some 16 hours later, on Sunday, the enforcement team spotted two more fishing vessels about one nautical mile from Kuala Terengganu and detained another 27 Vietnamese fishermen,” said Capt Zainolabidin.

According to Capt Zainolabidin, all the fishermen except 12 had no valid documents.

A 14-day remand order had been obtained against those detained.
Costa Rican Coast Guard officers arrested four men on a fishing boat carrying more than 2 metric tons of cocaine in the early hours of Thursday morning, according to the Public Security Ministry.

Coast Guard officers intercepted the boat off the coast of Cabo Blanco, the southernmost tip of the Nicoya Peninsula. On board, police found 164 packages of cocaine weighing 2,296 kg.

Cabo Blanco is also home to the eponymous nature reserve that includes more than 1,600 hectares of protected Pacific Ocean.

The four men arrested — three Nicaraguans and a Costa Rican — did not have criminal records. Police took the four to Caldera, Puntarenas for processing. If convicted, they would face up to 20 years in prison.

Thursday’s seizure comes a week after Coast Guard officers intercepted a boat on the Caribbean coast carrying more than a metric ton of marijuana.

According to figures from the Security Ministry, Costa Rica has seized nearly 10 metric tons of cocaine so far this year.

One of the Chinese vessels caught fishing illegally in a New Zealand fisheries operation has a record of unlawful activity.

The vessel is on a Greenpeace blacklist, which alleges that it has previously attempted to cover up illegal fishing activity by changing its name and log books.

It was revealed yesterday that two long-liners were allegedly caught fishing just outside New Zealand's Exclusive Economic Zone near the Kermadec Islands, which is soon to become a major marine sanctuary.

Neither had permits to fish in the area and one of the vessels was also allegedly catching Southern Bluefin Tuna, although no Chinese-flagged vessels are permitted to do so.

It is understood that the two ships are the Da Yang 15 and Da Yang 16 - both flagged to China.

The Da Yang 15 was allegedly guilty of other serious violations. It did not declare its shark catch and did not have "bird-scaring devices", which are required to stop seabirds from being caught in long-lines.

It was also not reporting to the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission's (WCPFC) satellite monitoring system.

Records show that both ships were previously flagged to Vanuatu. They changed their flags to China in March.

The Da Yang 15 was previously called Fong Kuo 3. That ship is on a Greenpeace blacklist, which accuses its owners of "fish laundering".

The environmental organisation said the vessel had covered up illegal activity by "fudging their documents" - changing names or the areas in which they were fishing in their log books.

New Zealand authorities have reported the vessels to China to investigate because they were outside New Zealand waters.

The Southern Bluefin Tuna are controlled by the Commission of the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna which China is not a party to and none of its vessels can legally catch the fish.

A spokeswoman for the Ministry of Primary Industries would not say which countries were involved because it could undermine the investigations. In total 37 vessels flagged to six different countries were boarded during the patrol.

"All countries involved have assured the New Zealand authorities that investigations are being carried out and will report back to us and the WCPFC as soon as they are completed."

The countries in question were required by international law to investigate and apply sanctions if required.

New Zealand authorities only have jurisdiction to investigate illegal fishing within New Zealand's waters, but it can take further action if it is unhappy with any sanctions by the country to which a vessel is flagged.

The serious violations were also reported to the Western Central Pacific Fisheries Commission, which has oversight of the area in question. Neither of the vessels had licenses to fish there.

The boats were caught during Operation Zodiac, a joint Royal NZ Navy and Ministry of Primary Industries annual operation on the high seas north of New Zealand.

Labour MP Rino Tirikatene said New Zealand should ensure China took the necessary sanctions.

"We need to apply pressure on China to blacklist their own boats that are fishing on the high seas."

New Zealand and China had cooperated in illegal fishing in other areas, including the Southern Ocean where China recently seized a catch of toothfish from a vessel.

However, it comes at a tense time for Chinese and New Zealand trade relations after reports China had threatened trade reprisals over a complaint about dumping of Chinese steel in New Zealand.

Those reports have been dismissed as "unsubstantiated rumours" by the Government but Zespri has confirmed it was one of the companies approached by Chinese industry figures.

China announced last week it was toughening up checks on kiwifruit exports after detecting a fungus on some New Zealand kiwifruit.
The suspect was arrested during a road block on the N2 near Lwandle in Cape Town.

JOHANNESBURG - Police in the Western Cape have arrested a 30-year-old man for possession of poached abalone worth R1.5 million.

The suspect was arrested during a road block on the N2 near Lwandle in Cape Town.

Police spokesperson Noloyiso Rwexana said, "I can confirm that a 30-year-old man from Hermanus is expected to appear in the Strands Magistrates Court on Monday facing charges related to illegal possession and transporting abalone."

More than a tonne of cocaine worth £80m has been found on a fishing boat near Falmouth.



Three men have been arrested and charged after the operation, described as "one of the most significant drug seizures ever made in the UK".



Around fifty bags worth were discovered onboard the trawler Bianca.

The officers deployed from two Border Force cutters, HMC Seeker and HMC Searcher.

Two National Crime Agency and Border Force Maritime Command boarding parties intercepted the vessel.



The Bianca was escorted to Falmouth where a full search was carried out supported by Border Force officers from the new Cornwall Hub. Officials said the vessel was found to have more than a tonne of cocaine on board.



Mark Harding of the NCA’s Border Policing Command said: "A seizure on this scale is likely have a significant disruptive impact right along the supply chain, leaving criminals with large debts to be covered. And it will have knock on effects, disrupting further criminality that would have been funded by the profits of this venture."



Border Force’s Director of National Operations Mike Stepney said: “This is one of the most significant drugs seizures ever made in the UK and a testament to the multi-agency approach we adopt to secure the UK’s border and territorial waters.

“By working closely with the NCA and our other national and international partners we were able to intercept this vessel before it could deliver its £80 million of cargo to the UK.

“This seizure is a fantastic example of the vital role our officers play in preventing drugs from reaching the UK and keeping our communities safe.”



The operation was assisted by the National Maritime Information Centre and Devon and Cornwall Police. The NCA investigation continues.



Three men were charged with importing the cocaine and appeared at Bodmin Magistrates Court on Saturday 20th August 2016. All three have been remanded in custody until their next hearing at Bristol Crown Court on 20th September.
The easterly wind has died down and the sea water is crystal clear. It is hard to find an empty spot on Cortadura beach, in Cádiz province. In the rocky area of Santibáñez, three youths in diving gear head out toward the shore with the firm intention of doing something illegal. They run back and forth carrying heavy baskets, and more than one beachgoer is heard wondering whether they might be carrying a shipment of hashish.

But then an anonymous citizen realizes what’s really going on, and calls 092 to ask the police to come stop the illegal harvesting of sea cucumbers. Three local officers show up and seize four baskets containing 200 kilograms of a small marine animal with a soft body known scientifically as Actinopyga echinites.

llegal harvesting has ballooned to such a degree that it is hard to find a single sea cucumber on popular beaches like La Caleta

So far this year, municipal officers have already confiscated a ton and a half of these echinoderms, which have inhabited Spain’s southern coasts for millions of years. Sea cucumbers do not bite or sting, and do not seem to move or defend themselves in any way. They simply live on the coast, drifting along with the tide and filtering the water.

Until three years ago, local fishermen only used them as fishing bait. But then word got out that sea cucumbers are a delicacy in China, where they are believed to have therapeutic and aphrodisiac properties. Since then, illegal harvesting has ballooned to such a degree that it is hard to find a single sea cucumber on popular beaches like La Caleta.

“If this pace keeps up, a year from now it’s going to be hard finding any at all; the species is becoming endangered,” says Ernesto Pérez, an official with the local police’s special services unit.

Pérez is one of the officers in charge of fighting the illegal harvesting of sea cucumbers. The regional government of Andalusia and Seprona, the Civil Guard’s nature protection department, make up the rest of the team.

But they are dealing with a well-established chain with many links that start with the local harvesters and end in China. So far this year, the Andalusian department of fisheries has initiated 69 proceedings in the coasts of Cádiz and Málaga; most of the fines are being slapped on the harvesters who physically pull the creatures out of the water.

High prices

José (an assumed name) is one of these harvesters. He runs online ads to attract Chinese buyers living in Cádiz. “I don’t pick many anymore because things have gotten really tough with the fines,” he admits. “I deliver them right on the beach, where a person pays me for the basket on the spot.”

José would rather not reveal how much he makes, but suggests that it is worth his while.

Legislation badly needed If all those involved in the harvest of sea cucumbers agree on anything at all, it is on the need to end the legal loophole that is hurting the species. The difference lies in how to do so. A decree issued by the Andalusian government in 2010 establishes that sea cucumbers “may only be captured in demarcated and classified production zones.” This makes it illegal to harvest them recreationally. This activity entails fines of anywhere between €300 and €60,000. Francisco Javier Gutiérrez, the businessman with the licenses, says it is necessary to determine harvesting quotas. José, the illegal harvester, agrees: “If the Junta [regional government] allowed for a controlled harvest, I would be first in line to go legal and become a self-employed worker.”

“It’s quite a lot, because I won’t risk it for peanuts. I’m the lowest link in the chain, and I suppose that prices in China must be frightfully high.”

Middlemen typically pay people like José around €70 for a basket, the local police said. These intermediaries clean, cook and dry the product before selling it to Chinese citizens residing in Cádiz, who in turn smuggle it into China.

“They place them inside suitcases and travel with them, acting as mules. They caught one recently at Barajas airport,” explains Francisco Javier Gutiérrez, one of just two businessmen in Spain with “all the required licenses” to do trade in sea cucumbers.

Gutiérrez sells up to five different types, with the cheapest one going for €48 plus tax per kilogram. He captures them off the Pacific coastline, where harvesting is allowed, and sends them to Japan. From there they get shipped to China, where “a kilogram commands around €500.”

But this price could shoot up to €1,500 if the specimen resembles the Japanese sea cucumber, which used to be harvested on the coast of Japan until the radiation from the Fukushima accident ruled out any further use for culinary purposes.

Gutiérrez complains that more is not being done against illegal harvesting. “Action is being taken against the harvester, but the people who buy are just as guilty as the people who sell. All you need to do is take a look online to find a bunch of illegal ads,” he adds.

Pérez, the local police officer, admits that they are only able to seize a part of the illegal harvest taking place on Cádiz's coast.

“We are highly aware that many more are getting away,” he explains. His department deals only with the first step in the illegal activity; it is up to Seprona to dismantle the sales network behind the trade in sea cucumbers.

From drugs to sea cucumbers

Pérez adds that three or four years ago, it was Chinese nationals who personally picked the animals out of the sea. “But it was very conspicuous and citizens who saw them would call us immediately,” he recalls.

That was when the Chinese turned to local harvesters instead. “There is an excess of demand, and exorbitant prices are being paid out,” says Pérez.

For the harvesters, the benefits are obvious. Besides the ease of capture, harvesting sea cucumbers does not entail prison terms if they are caught. There are, however, hefty fines that can reach €60,000. Regional authorities explain that this is because there is no specific regulation on sea cucumbers, which are merely classified as “a species that cannot be captured.”

The police officer also notes that several small-time drug traffickers have now turned into amateur harvesters, and admits that their own raids are “increasingly like drug trafficking raids.”

Typically, these harvesters go out at night on zodiac boats, bring home their loads and dry them on the balcony. “Being private property, it is hard to get a judge to grant a search warrant for an administrative violation,” adds the officer.

Instead, the local police rely on citizen cooperation. People, say Pérez, “are highly aware of how decimated the species is.”

Meanwhile, José will continue to risk a heavy fine to bring home sea cucumbers. “There is no work, so you hold on to anything you can find,” says the young man to justify his actions.

Pérez has heard this argument before, but he is not sympathetic.

“They are scared of immediate consequences, and this carries no prison terms,” he says. “But they are not aware that they are slaves to a ring, and that they risk mortgaging their entire lives to a fine that they will not be able to pay off.”
The Navy arrested two men attempting to smuggle 5.5 kg of gold to India in a fishing boat on Saturday night.

The arrest was made in the seas off Kankesanthurai. The suspects were attempting to transport the stock of gold in a fishing boat disguised themselves as fishermen, a Navy spokesperson said.

He said after receiving intelligence information, the Navy carried out a sudden raid and sailors onboard P 464 Fast Attack Craft managed to recover the stock of gold.

The arrested persons along with the gold were handed over to the Jaffna Customs Officials for further investigations, the Navy said.
AN illegal fishing vessel carrying five tonnes of sea cucumber was seized north of Cairns by the Maritime Border Command at the weekend.

The boat, which was believed to be Vietnamese, was intercepted on Saturday on suspicion it was illegally fishing in Australian waters. Australian Border Force officers also found dive equipment aboard the foreign vessel.

Australian Fisheries Management Authority fisheries operations general manager Peter Venslovas said the health of the waters north of Australia was “tempting” to illegal fishers.

“Our strict rules and regulations mean that we have a healthy marine environment and sustainable fisheries,” Mr Venslovas said.

“However, fishing without permission undermines the very rules and regulations in place to ensure that Australians can continue to enjoy a healthy supply of seafood for many generations to come.

“This interception demonstrates our whole-of-government commitment to illegal fishing and sends a strong signal to those looking to plunder our resources.”

This is not the first time suspected illegal fishing vessels have been found off the coast of Far North Queensland this year.

In June the Cairns Post reported that about 30 illegal fishermen had been apprehended with a load of six tonnes of sea cucumber.

The apprehension of the 30 fishermen was the fourth incident of its kind this year.

In March, 28 illegal fishermen were arrested near the Lockhart River. The incident was believed to be the biggest arrest of illegal foreign fisherman in more than 30 years.
GEORGE TOWN: A 15-year-old was among six Indonesians nabbed by the Malaysian Maritime Enforce-ment Agency (MMEA) for fishing illegally in Malaysian waters.

Their fishing boat was spotted 29.1 nautical miles southwest of Pulau Kendi at 5.24pm on Sunday.

MMEA Maritime 2 district deputy director (operation) Commander Azman Samsudin said the skipper and five crew members, aged between 15 and 36 from Medan, failed to produce valid documents and a permit to fish in Malaysian waters.

“All of them were busy fishing and weren’t aware of our presence,” he said yesterday.

Azman said MMEA seized their 100kg catch and fishing equipment.

Foiled attempt: MMEA officers impounding the boat to Batu Maung.

“The vessel was brought back to the Batu Maung jetty,” he added.

The case is being investigated under Section 15 (1)(a) of the Fisheries Act 1985 for fishing in Malaysian waters without permission.

If convicted, they face up to RM100,000 fine each while the skipper could be fined up to RM1mil.
Abalone smugglers get harsh sentences



Two men were sentenced to 18 months imprisonment and fined R500,000 in the Khayelitsha Priority Crimes court for smuggling abalone and for cultivating dagga. Han Ran (31) and Zhao Huirm (35) were arrested in April‚ when police‚ assisted by the Department of Agriculture Forestry and Fisheries‚ responded to information of alleged illegal activity on a small holding on the outskirts of Langebaan‚ a police statement said on Friday.They discovered an illegal abalone processing facility that included a cooking area‚ drying rooms and a sorting room. Numerous items of equipment used to process the abalone were found‚ including gas burners and cylinders‚ scales‚ fans‚ drying shelves and temperature meters.About 37 900 units of dried abalone and five units of wet shucked abalone were confiscated during the arrest.Police also found three rooms equipped as hydroponic laboratories. Various lights‚ reflectors‚ fans and other items of equipment were seized.Dagga plants were growing in a hothouse at the rear of the building.“We are pleased with the outcome of this case and regard the sentences as a deterrent for poachers of our marine resources‚” South African Police Services said.
The arrests followed a coordinated effort between the Marine Nationale (Gabonese Navy), the ANPA (Fisheries Enforcement Agency) and Sea Shepherd to secure the Gabonese border with the Republic of Congo (Congo) from incursions made by illegal fishing vessels.

At the time of interception the Congolese pirogues were actively engaged in illegal fishing, with gillnets, inside Gabon's territorial waters. The wooden canoes, with 11 fishermen from the Republic of Congo, Benin, and Ghana on-board, were found with a combined total of approximately 150 sharks, including endangered scalloped hammerhead sharks and black tip reef sharks as well as devil rays in their fish holds.

After the arrests the M/Y Bob Barker escorted the pirogues to Mayumba, Gabon, where they will be held pending criminal investigation.

Launched in April, Operation Albacore is a joint campaign between Sea Shepherd, the government of Gabon and more recently the government of São Tomé and Príncipe to tackle illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing in the Gulf of Guinea.

Since the beginning of the 2016 tuna fishing season, marines from the Marine Nationale and officers with the ANPA have been stationed on-board the M/Y Bob Barker, working alongside Sea Shepherd crew to patrol Gabon's sovereign waters, under the direction of the government of Gabon.

In August São Tomé and Príncipe authorities partnered with the Operation Albacore mission, following an accord signed with Gabon in late 2015, to extend patrolling grounds and increase the protection of critical tuna habitat in the region. The M/Y Bob Barker is being provided by Sea Shepherd Global in the joint agreement as a vehicle for law enforcement.

Sea Shepherd Operation Albacore Campaign Leader, Captain Peter Hammarstedt, said, “Three months ago, a night time raid by Gabonese authorities, assisted by Sea Shepherd, resulted in the arrest of 3 illegal fishing trawlers from Congo. The recent arrest of two pirogues, using gillnets to catch endangered sharks, speaks to the importance of maintaining a constant patrolling presence to both detect and deter illegal fishing”.

Royal Netherlands Navy offshore patrol ship HNLMS Groningem has seized two tonnes of cocaine after intercepting a small fishing boat in the Caribbean Sea.

Five crew members were detained and transferred to the U.S. Coast Guard together with the found contraband.

A U.S. maritime reconnaissance plane spotted the fishing boat and directed the navy ship with an embarked American boarding team towards it.

Members of the boarding team had to be quick as the fishing boat’s engine broke down and the boat started taking on water. The team managed to find the cocaine hidden in a compartment in the boat before it sank.

HNLMS Groningen currently serves as the Royal Netherlands Navy station ship in the Caribbean. The ship’s tasks include counterdrug operations conducted in cooperation with a number of international agencies fighting to stem the flow of drugs.
Three Malaysian-flagged fishing vessels from Vietnam were caught illegally fishing in Bintan waters, Riau Islands, on Thursday.

Patrol vessel KP Hiu 14 belonging to the Maritime Affairs and Fisheries Ministry arrested 48 Vietnamese citizens, who were crew members of the three boats. Another vessel detected by the ministry managed to escape into Malaysian waters.

The ministry’s fishery and maritime resources monitoring directorate general’s (PSDKP) Batam office head Akhmadon said the three Vietnamese vessels were detained as they trawled around 22 miles off Bintan Island.

“Foreign fishing vessels have gone deeper into Indonesian waters while in previous cases, they only dared to fish in border areas. It’s very ironic to see that rampant illegal fishing practices continue despite our tough law enforcement against perpetrators by destroying their vessels,” said Akhmadon on Friday.

The three vessels are machine vessel KM Murkhan 5, with 22 crew members, KM Karang 6 with 21 crew members and KM JMS 00637 with five crew members.

Patrol personnel found 3 tons of different types of fish inside cooler facilities on the three vessels.

“We have secured them [vessels and fish] as evidence. We are coordinating with the immigration office to legally process the 48 crew members and hope that they will be deported immediately,” said Akhmadon.

He said the crew members of the three vessels would be charged under Law No.45/2009 on fisheries. “It is hoped that within 30 days, their case documents can be handed over to the court,” said Akhmadon. (ebf)

Western Cape — A multidisciplinary team consisting the HAWKS, SAPS' K9 and DAFF, executed a search and seizure warrant at a farm in Vredenburg on Wednesday morning, culminating in the arrest of six suspects aged between 31 and 48 for running an illegal abalone facility.

Equipment and abalone with an estimated value of over R2.5 Million was seized. The continued identification and dismantlement of such illegal facilities has a direct bearing on addressing the plundering of the country's precious marine resources, we shall continue with these raids unabatedly. We would like to further urge the public to work closely with us in identifying possible illegal facilities.

North Sulawesi Police have arrested two people suspected of involvement in counterfeiting Indonesian ID cards for 11 Filipino sailors caught on board a fishing vessel.

The arrest was a follow up to a raid on illegal fishing in September by joint task force Satgas 115, which stopped the D’Von in the waters of North Sulawesi. On board the D’Von, the task force found 11 Filipinos holding Indonesian ID cards issued by Bitung municipal administration.

Following further investigations police arrested the owner of the D’Von, identified only as DL, and an official in Bitung Population and Civil Registry Agency, identified only as NL.

Bitung administration spokesperson Erwin Kontu said they would punish officials who were found to have helped counterfeit the ID cards. “The regulations say we can fire them, and now the case is in North Sulawesi Police’s hands, it is a legal process,” he said Friday.

“Other civil servants must learn a lesson from this case,” he said.

North Sulawesi Police spokesperson Sr. Comr. Marjuki said fake ID cards played a role in illegal fishing by Filipinos in North Sulawesi waters.

“DL paid Rp 2.5 million [US$191] for each ID card. NL made the ID cards and got Rp 500,000 per card,” said Marjuki.

Marjuki did not explain where the remaining Rp 2 million went. (evi)
A total of 28 Vietnamese crew and five fishing boats were captured by the Thai Navy’s frigate and patrol boats for illegal fishing in the Thai waters yesterday and today.

All the crew were later brought to the Navy’s Second Fleet base in Songkhla yesterday and last night from Pattani and Nakhon Si Thammarat provinces for detention.

According to the Second Fleet commander Vice Admiral Pornchai Pinthong, the Navy’s frigate “Khamronsin” captured three Vietnamese fishing boats and detained 15 crew members after they entered the Thai territorial waters.

The frigate of the Second Fleet based in Songkhla was on the way back from routine patrol off Pattani coast in the southern sea when it spotted the three vessels fishing for sea cucumbers with trawl nets near Ko Losin islet, about 11 nautical miles from Pattani coast.

All were captured.

While escorting the boats on the way back to the Songkhla base, two fishing boats sank after being hit by high waves and water leaking into their engine rooms.

All 15 crew were then rescued and taken on board the frigate, accompanied by another boat to the base. They arrived at Songkhla base late last night.

Meanwhile two other Vietnamese boats with 13 crew were also captured last night off Nakhon Si Thammarat coast by Tor 97 patrol boat, and escorted to the Songkhla base.

Questioning all the captured skippers and crew revealed that the crew of two boats captured by Tor 97 patrol boat off Nakhon Si Thammarat province came from Kien Giang province in Vietnam.

The three others captured by the frigate came from Ca Mau province.

Initially all were charged for illegally fishing in Thai waters.

The authorities were in the process of coordinating with the Vietnamese embassy for acknowledgement.

All were sent to Songkhla police station for trial before being sent back.
80 more PH fishers jailed in Indonesia for illegal fishing Share it! Share Tweet

By Philippines News Agency

At least 80 more fishermen from General Santos City and other parts of Mindanao have been arrested and detained in Indonesia for allegedly illegal fishing violations.

Daniel Te, head of the Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) Regional Consular Office-12, said the fishermen were crew members of eight to 10 fishing boats that were apprehended last month by Indonesian naval authorities after reportedly encroaching its territorial waters.

He said most of those apprehended were light tuna fishing boats owned by operators based in this city.

“We are very sad (with this development) because the government has facilitated a number of successful repatriations these past months,” he said in an interview over a local television station, referring to the 403 fishermen who have returned home since January.

At least 174 fishermen who were previously jailed in Bitung and Manado in North Sulawesi, Indonesia were sent home by the DFA through assistance from Bitung-based Filipino businessman Voltaire Loma.

Some 136 fishermen were repatriated in February and 93 more in May through the efforts of the Consulate General in Manado and assistance from Loma and the Philippine Navy.

Most of the repatriates were released from detention after completing their sentences for immigration and illegal fishing violations.

Prior to the latest apprehensions, Te said only around 100 to 150 fishermen were still languishing in various jails in Indonesia.

“Our Consulate General in Manado has already coordinated with Indonesian authorities regarding the status of the arrested fishermen,” he said.

But citing previous experiences, he said the release of the fishing boat operators could take some time.

Yemeni authorities announced on Monday that they detected an Iranian ship practicing illegal fishing in Yemen’s national coasts near the Gulf of Aden in Southern Yemen.

Yemen News Agency SABA, affiliated to President Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi’s government, quoted naval commander in Socotra Island Colonel Ali Salmeen saying that a military battalion seized an Iranian ship while it was illegally fishing in the Yemeni waters near to Abd All-Kuri and Samhah islands in Socotra archipelago province.

Salmeen added that the ship was transferred to Socotra, after being seized, and was handed over to the leader of the first infantry marine, in preparation for investigating with passengers and taking legal actions.

The Yemeni official did not reveal about the number of people who were on board of the Iranian ship. Also, there has been no response from Tehran following the accusations.

The Yemeni Minister of Fisheries Fahd Kafain had said in previous statements that Iranian ships rolled into Yemeni waters proactively near to Abd All-Kuri and Samhah islands in the south-west of Socotra archipelago. He described the action as an encroach on Yemeni waters, flagrant violation of international law, and damaging the marine resources.

AN Indonesian boat used in an illegal fishing venture off the Australian coast has felt the wrath of the Australian Border Force.

The vessel, which was apprehended during a dual agency operation, was first spotted by surveillance aircraft late last month. The boat was captured after a short pursuit from Australian maritime authorities 16 nautical miles inside of the Australian Exclusive Economic Zone, about 175 nautical miles northwest of Darwin. It will be alleged officers seized about 20kg of fresh sea cucumbers, 12 bags of dried sea cucumbers between 20 and 50kg each, 15kg of fish and one crayfish.

Diving equipment, along with a spear gun and several wet suits were also found on board.

The boat was incinerated at Bhagwan Marine, East Arm, yesterday morning.
Eight people have been arrested over a multi-million dollar drug smuggling operation off Australia's east coast.

Around $54 million worth of ice was found on a boat as it arrived at Palm Beach, in Sydney's north last Friday.

It followed a large-scale joint operation between Australian and Chinese authorities that began earlier this month.

Three men from China who were on board a small tender - launched from a larger vessel being monitored by the Australian Border Force - were arrested by Australian Federal Police, as well as the two men from New Zealand and Taiwan who met the boat onshore.

Three barrels containing around 90 litres of liquid methamphetamine were discovered on board.

All five men have been charged with the importation and possession of a commercial quantity of border-controlled drugs and faced court last Friday.

Three other men were then arrested on Sunday after a fishing boat was intercepted off the coast of Hervey Bay, Queensland.

They were all charged with aiding and abetting the importation of a commercial quantity of a border-controlled drug.

All eight men have been refused bail.

Justice Minister Michael Keenan said the seizure was a very serious blow against organised criminals who peddle in the misery of drug trafficking.

"This interception comes as a result of the strong ties and intelligence gained from our law enforcement partners in China," he said in a statement on Thursday.

"Together we are determined to disrupt the insidious ice trade that continues to pose a significant risk to the communities of Australia and China."

Since the partnership with Chinese authorities began a year ago, approximately six tonnes of drugs and precursors have been seized.
Indonesian authorities have apprehended the Malaysian-flagged PAF 4767 vessel, which is from Vietnam, as it was allegedly fishing illegally in Natuna waters. The Maritime and Fisheries Resources Monitoring Task Force (PSDKP) also seized a ton of malong fish from the vessel.

Batam PSDKP head Akhmadon said on Wednesday said the arrest of the crew was based on radar and visual observations from the Hiu 12 patrol ship since Saturday.

“The Vietnamese vessel was apprehended when it was using a Malaysian flag. They usually catch fish illegally in groups but we only arrested one of the vessels,” he said.

Skipper Le Van Trung and 14 crew, all of whom are Vietnamese, were arrested and are awaiting deportation.

“The skipper will be charged for his misconduct,” Akhmadon said, adding that he would be charged under Law No. 31/2004 on fisheries.

“We still don’t understand why they used a Malaysian flag,” he added, alleging that it could have been because of an agreement between Indonesia and Malaysia to immediately deport fishermen arrested in one other’s territory.

The PAF 4767 is the fourth Vietnamese vessel with a Malaysian flag to have been apprehended by the Batam PSDKP. Previously on Oct. 13 the task force arrested three Vietnamese vessels using Malaysian flags. (yan)
PHUKET: The Royal Thai Navy yesterday afternoon seized seven tuna fishing boats at Tha Sri Thai pier in Rassada for faking nationality documents to enter Thailand.

The investigations are being conducted by a joint task force of the Navy, Immigration, the Marine Office, the Employment Office, the Marine Police and other officers, and led by Vice Admiral Suraphol Kuptaphan, commander of the Royal Thai Navy Third Area Command.

The boats were named as Yutuna 3, Abubant 1, Abubant 3, Abubant 6, Abubant 9, Abubant 12, and Shun Lai.

Two other boats were also named in the investigations; Yutuna No 1, which was requested to stop but instead turned around and left, and Sheng Ji Qun 3, which had entered Thailand previously but left the pier on November 15 before the investigation started.

“All nine boats requested to enter Thailand and tie up at the pier, stating boat repairs as the purpose of entry. We started to investigate after we found their documents to be suspicious. They claimed to carry a Bolivian boat registration licence, but after the marine office checked with Bolivian officials, they confirmed that none of the boats was registered there,” said V/Adm Suraphol.

Investigations revealed that all the captains and crew members had legal licences. The captains are mostly Taiwanese, and most of the crew members are Indonesian and Singaporean.

The Marine Office filed a complaint at Wichit Police Station against the agencies that processed and approved the documents for these boats, namely Xiang Hao Co Ltd, Yi Hong Fishery Co Ltd and Suan Ying Co Ltd. The charges include submitting fake documents to enter Thailand, faking documents, and providing fake information to officers.

Additionally, Shun Lai and Abubant 9 did not notify the Marine Office at least 24 hours prior to berthing at the pier, and were fined 5,000 baht each.

“We will not allow any of the boats to leave until the owners come and provide proof of nationality. If no one appears, we will seize the boats and sell them,” said V/Adm Suraphol.

“Controlling illegal fishing is an important agenda for the government, so all relevant officers are keeping a strict eye on suspicious activities, especially on foreign vessels entering Thailand from the Andaman.”

The Sri Lankan Navy arrested 29 fishermen for the use of illegal fishing equipment in the seas off Seelawathura in Mannar.

Navy Spokesperson Captain Akram Alavi said that the fishing equipment in their possession was also seized.

The navy spokesperson added that the arrested fishermen were handed over to the custody of the District Fisheries Office, in Mannar for further investigations.

JAKARTA - A Singaporean boat captain acquitted of illegal fishing in Indonesia's waters but still held by local authorities is facing a 100 million rupiah (about S$11,000) fine for allegedly entering Indonesian waters illegally.

The prosecutors made the demand against Mr Shoo Chiau Huat on Tuesday (Dec 20) before a panel of three judges during a hearing in Tanjung Pinang court. The fine can be substituted with a six-month jail term.

Mr Shoo's lawyer Herman Black said on Tuesday that the fine demanded is excessive, considering Mr Shoo's humble profession.

Mr Black will present his defence statement for Mr Shoo in the next hearing scheduled for Jan 4, while the court is expected to pass its ruling on Jan 11.

On April 16, Mr Shoo was carrying 13 passengers from Singapore and Malaysia, mainly recreational anglers, on the MV Selin when the boat was stopped by the Indonesian navy in the waters of Tanjung Berakit off Bintan island, for trespassing.

All passengers were arrested and deported about a week later but Mr Shoo was charged with illegal fishing in Indonesian waters.

A court, however, ruled that there was insufficient evidence and acquitted him in July.

But Mr Shoo remains in the custody of local immigration authorities after he was charged with an immigration offence instead.

His lawyer, Mr Herman, then appealed to the court to throw out the case against his client on the grounds of "irregularity".

Mr Black said the immigration offence faced by Mr Shoo was based on his arrest by the navy for illegal fishing, a charge which his client has been acquitted of previously.

Mr Shoo, who has been behind bars since April, previously told The Straits Times that he intends to quit his job as a fishing boat captain once he is released.

"This case has been very traumatising, all I did was take people out to sea for fishing, but look what I have been going through," he added. "I'm also worried that my elderly father may find out about this, because if he does, it will make him feel stressed that I've spent so much time in prison."

The Singapore Ministry of Foreign Affairs had sent a diplomatic note to the Indonesian authorities against Mr Shoo's detention. The ministry told The Straits Times in August it was monitoring his case "with concern" and had "sought clarification on the legal basis for Mr Shoo's detention".
Karachi: Pakistan on Sunday released 220 Indian fishermen held for trespassing into its territorial waters as a “goodwill gesture" to its nuclear-armed rival India, officials said. “We released 220 Indian fishermen today as a goodwill gesture," deputy superintendent of Karachi’s Malir prison Hassan Sehto told AFP, adding that 219 others still remain in Pakistani custody.

The freed fishermen are expected to cross over into India on Monday. Indian and Pakistani fishermen are frequently detained for illegal fishing since the Arabian Sea border is not clearly defined and many boats lack the technology to fix their precise location.

The fishermen often languish in jail, even after serving their terms, as poor diplomatic ties between the two neighbours mean fulfilling bureaucratic requirements can take a long time.

Relations between the two nations have plummeted since a deadly attack on an Indian army base in the disputed region of Kashmir in September, which New Delhi blamed on Pakistan-based Islamist group Jaish-e-Mohammed.

There have since been repeated outbreaks of cross-border firing, with both sides reporting deaths and injuries.

Kashmir has been divided between India and Pakistan since the end of British colonial rule in 1947. Both claim the Himalayan territory in full and have fought two wars over the mountainous region.

GWADAR: A complete shutterdown was observed on Tuesday in the coastal Jiwani town in protest against illegal fishing by Sindh trawlers in the Arabian Sea near the area which was causing immense loss to local fishermen.

Protesters raised slogans and staged a sit-in outside the offices of the fisheries department. Fishermen also held a demonstration in the port city of Gwadar.

President of the fisherfolk forum Nazeer Ahmed Baloch said that the entire town remained locked down. Sindh trawlers, he said, were fishing near the Jiwani coast violating the Fisheries Act in connivance with the local officials of the fisheries department trawlers coming from Sindh were not only involved in illegal fishing but also damaging the fishing nets of local fishermen, he said.

Mr Baloch said that the elected representatives were not giving any attention to this important issue despite repeated protests and sit-ins.

Sixty-six Indian fishermen have been arrested for alleged illegal fishing in Pakistani waters and a court here remanded them into custody on Saturday. The Indian fishermen along with five boats were arrested last evening for “illegally” fishing in Pakistan’s territorial waters and have been sent to jail by a judicial magistrate.

Watch What Else Is making News

The Maritime Security Agency had arrested the fishermen and seized five boats yesterday, a spokesman for the agency said.

“The fishermen were arrested after they remained in Pakistani waters in the Arabian Sea despite warnings to move out of our territorial waters,” the spokesman said.

The arrests come just five days after the Pakistan government released 220 Indian fishermen and sent them home via Wagah border on December 26 as a goodwill gesture.

On November 20, the Pakistani Maritime Security Agency had arrested 43 Indian fishermen for entering its territorial waters.

Amin Marri, the station house officer of Docks police station, said the fishermen were booked under the Foreigner’s Act and the Fisheries Act and had now been sent to jail on court orders after being provided with clothing and food by a welfare organisation.

Pakistan and India frequently arrest fishermen as there is no clear demarcation of the maritime border in the Arabian Sea and these fishermen do not have boats equipped with the technology to know their precise location.

A government task force charged with curbing illegal fishing on the Tonle Sap lake caught 40 fishermen after they briefly clashed with authorities on Tuesday evening over the seizure of their illicit gear, officials said on Wednesday.

Nao Thuok, secretary of state at the Agriculture Ministry, said about 80 police, military police and fisheries officials aboard speedboats seized three trawlers after descending on a fishing area in Pursat province’s Krakor district at about 6 p.m. on Tuesday.

The fishermen—armed with axes and knives—attempted to fight back, and officers “shot about 10 or 20 bullets into the air to scare them,” Mr. Thuok said. The 40 fishermen were sent to the Pursat Provincial Court on Wednesday.

Agriculture Minister Veng Sakhon, Interior Minister Sar Kheng and National Police Chief Neth Savoeun surveyed the sprawling lake by helicopter on Wednesday as a part of monthly inspections. Mr. Sakhon said they saw evidence of widespread illegal fishing activity.

“We can see a lot of illegal fishing gear, such as tiny mesh nets in the lake, especially in Kompong Chhnang, Kompong Thom and Pursat provinces,” Mr. Sakhon said.

Mr. Kheng, who has warned the governors of provinces that ring the lake that they would lose their jobs if they did not halt illegal fishing, has called them to a meeting on Friday in Phnom Penh, he said.

Speaking at City Hall on Wednesday, Mr. Kheng said that Kompong Chhnang and Kompong Thom provinces remained rife with illegal fishing, and that the task force needed to continue stamping out the use of illegal gear.

Prime Minister Hun Sen signed a sub-decree setting up the task force. It has arrested 52 fishermen and impounded 21 boats since January 1, according to Mr. Thuok.

Minh Bunly, Tonle Sap program coordinator for NGO Fisheries Action Coalition Team, said that if the task force was truly committed to stamping out illegal fishing, they would continue ramping up their enforcement operations.

Illegal fishermen “are no longer as adamant as they were before,” he said. “They look scared.”

Environmental groups have long warned of overfishing on the Tonle Sap, with some saying that damage to fish stocks is already irreversible.

news, latest-news, DPI, NSW, Fisheries, abalone, Sydney, Mogo, illegal, seizure

A Mogo man and a Western Sydney seafood restaurant owner have been arrested following the seizure of more than 3300 illegal South Coast abalone and 40 kilograms of shark fin, the largest abalone haul in more than 20 years. The seizure followed a joint operation by the Department of Primary Industries (DPI) Fisheries and NSW Police investigating illegal abalone trafficking from the South Coast to unlicensed Sydney-based receivers. The raid, which took place in the early hours of Sunday morning, is estimated to be worth more than $57,000. Abalone is listed as a priority species and is an indictable species under the Fisheries Management Act DPI director of fisheries compliance Patrick Tully said. “Following an extended and targeted surveillance operation by fisheries officers from the Statewide Operations and Investigations Group, a 59-year-old man from Mogo NSW was intercepted in the western Sydney suburb of Berala,” he said. “It will be alleged the man delivered a consignment of illicit abalone to a residence in Berala. “Shortly after leaving the house, the man’s vehicle was intercepted with the assistance of NSW Police where 439 abalone in the vehicle were seized along with documentation allegedly relating to abalone trafficking. “The man’s vehicle was seized and he was arrested and taken to Auburn Police Station.” DPI fisheries investigators executed a search warrant on the house at Berala and seized 2870 alleged illegal abalone weighing approximately 300 kilograms. Fisheries officers also located and seized 40 kilograms of shark fin. Investigations into the origin of the shark fin are continuing. An associated Western Sydney seafood restaurant was also raided, with officers seizing a further 645 prohibited size abalone. “A 62-year-old man, who is also the owner of a Western Sydney seafood restaurant, will face a range of charges including trafficking in fish which carries a maximum penalty of 10 years imprisonment,” Mr Tully said. NSW Police marine area commander detective superintendent Mark Hutchings said NSW Police work closely with DPI to target the illegal poaching of marine life, in all its forms. "We have a strong relationship with NSW DPI Fisheries officers fisheries and will continue to work closely with them as a partner agency to detect the trafficking and illegal sale of abalone, in particular,” Det Supt Hutchings said. "Anyone with information that could assist police regarding their investigations into these incidents is urged to contact Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000.” Apart from the maximum of 10 years jail the men face, individuals convicted of trafficking abalone can also receive a fine up to 10 times the market value of the abalone. “The market value of the abalone seized is worth more than $57,000,” Mr Tully said, making a fine of more than $570,000 possible. “If you are offered to purchase cheap abalone or from an unlicensed commercial fisher you could be involved in the trafficking of illegal abalone. “The quality, handling and hygiene of illegal abalone is unsafe and doesn’t follow the strict guidelines in place by NSW Food Authority for seafood, so not only could you get a criminal record and face large fines, but you could become very sick from eating it. “The only way to guarantee the quality of abalone, is to buy it from a reputable seafood retailer.” Both men are expected to face court in the near future. Anyone with information on suspected illegal fishing activity is urged to contact their local Fisheries Office or call the Fishers Watch phone line on 1800 043 536.

KARACHI: The Maritime Security Agency (MSA) on Friday took into the custody 60 Indian fishermen for fishing in Pakistani waters, an official said.

“The Indian fishermen were arrested by the MSA while they were fishing in Pakistani limits of the Arabian Sea,” said an MSA official. “The agency also seized their 10 boats being used in illegal fishing. All the arrested fishermen were later handed over to local police for further legal formalities.”

An official at the Docks police station said that a case against under Sections 3/4 of the Foreigners Act and 3/9 of the Fishery Act was registered against the Indian fishermen. Most of the arrested fishermen, he added, belonged to the Indian state of Gujarat.

The arrest came days after Pakistan released from the Landhi jail 217 Indian fishermen on Jan 5. A week before the release, the government had freed another 230 Indian fishermen.

Q COSTA RICA (Fusion.net) San Jose – On February 7th, a Costa Rican judge delivered the country’s first-ever prison sentence for illegal trade in shark fins.

After a lengthy judicial battle, a Taiwanese-born businesswoman was sentenced to serve six months of jail time over a fishing-haul of 652 shark fins detached from the animals’ bodies, a practice commonly known as shark finning.

The case, however, had a nasty twist.

- paying the bills -

Tied up in small packages each about 30 inches long, the “sharks” that customs and fishing officials retrieved from the cold stores onboard the fishing boat Wang Jia Men 88 in 2011 bore little resemblance to actual animals.

“They were folded and laced with string, almost like a birthday present.”

“They were folded and laced with string, almost like a birthday present,” testified one of the officials who was present at the landing dock, according to court documents.

As officials opened the frozen bundles and stretched their content on the fishing dock in the western port city of Puntarenas, the scene turned from baffling to gruesome. Most of the flesh had been carved out and only a bloody spine gave a vague resemblance of a shark.

The fins, the most valued part of the animal if you know the right buyer, were barely attached by small strips of skin. Officials counted 151 spines. Shark fins are used primarily for shark fin soup, a Chinese delicacy, and are one of the most expensive seafood products in the world.

The Asian-born crew members, none of whom spoke Spanish and required translation from the ship’s owner, likely wanted to bypass a 2005 Costa Rican law against shark finning—which states fins must arrive to port naturally attached to the bodies—by claiming there was no artificial mechanism keeping them in place.

- paying the bills -

Finning is by no means a new phenomenon. As global demand increased in the late 20th century and storage space on boats was outpaced, fishermen around the world began slashing the fins and dumping the sharks back into the ocean to die.

This way they maximized revenue by only keeping the most profitable part of the animal, but at the same time they savaged populations.

“If ships only carry fins, many more sharks will die as fishermen can pack more in the same storage space,” explained Erick Ross, Science Manager at Marviva Foundation, a leading marine conservation NGO in the Eastern Tropical Pacific.

But the spine-plus-fins bundle was a novelty. The case was so unusual that it prompted Interpol to alert its 190 member countries of the modus operandi in 2013.

Despite the efforts to mask the crime, judge Simón Angulo saw through them and sentenced the ship’s owner Hue Ju Tseng Chang, 36, to serve jail time.

- paying the bills --

Environmental lawyers and conservationists are lauding the case as an inflection point in the Central American republic’s quest to eradicate this industry.

“To reach a point where there’s an actual criminal sanction reflects the growing concern in Costa Rica,” said Marco Quesada, country director for Conservation International, a global environmental organization.

For years, finning had given the famously green country a bad reputation towards its marine policies, even resulting in a Shark Enemy Award for then-President Abel Pacheco in 2005.

British chef Gordon Ramsay claims he was held at gunpoint in 2011 by the Taiwanese mafia that allegedly controlled the industry while filming a documentary in Puntarenas.

In 2012, then Waters and Oceans Vice Minister José Lino Chaves estimated that up to 400,000 sharks were caught for their fins the previous year.

In recent years, however, the country has worked to overcome its shortcomings, say Quesada and Ross, as a result of public opinion crying foul over the decimation of sharks.

A decree introduced in 2012 ordered the international fleet to unload on state-owned docks under official supervision, rather than on private facilities as foreign ships had previously done.

For that, President Laura Chinchilla received in 2013 a Shark-Guardian award by the same organization that had chastised the country years before.

As a Belize-flagged vessel, the Wang Jia Men 88 had to allow this inspection. After a tip from an association of traditional fishermen, officials doubled their search and found the frozen bundles.

Environmentalists and lawmakers around the world have worked to dwindle the practice and new prohibitions have gradually emerged, so industry members have resorted to gray areas and loopholes.

In 2002, for instance, the United States seized a record 64,695 pounds of shark fins from the King Diamond II, a U.S.-flagged, Hong Kong-based vessel bound for Guatemala.

However, an appeals court decided in 2008 that the government had no right to seize the fins and had to give them back to their owners (as a side note, the case had the perplexing name of US v. Approximately 64,695 Pounds of Shark Fins).

The judges argued that the boat wasn’t exactly a fishing vessel, since it had purchased the fins and not actually caught the sharks to which they belonged to, so the current law couldn’t apply. The 2011 Shark Conservation Act closed those loopholes.

In the Wang Jia Men 88 case, a judge ruled in favor of the businesswoman in a 2014 ruling, saying that she didn’t order the fins to be unloaded (the technical illegality in Costa Rica), but public prosecutors rebutted the decision and obtained a second trial, which sentenced her.

Now Tseng Chang can file an appeal of her own within two weeks after the ruling, but environmentalists are seeing the case’s significance beyond Costa Rican courts.

“If we achieve a progressive ruling, it can serve as precedent for shark finning cases in other countries.”

“This creates an international precedent,” said Conservation International’s Quesada.

The legal tricks aren’t the sole dominion of the fishing industry. Iconic cases can serve as models for judicial processes in other countries, said Gladys Martínez, senior attorney with the Interamerican Association for Environmental Defense (AIDA).

Along with Conservation International, her organization surgically chose the case and helped the prosecutor’s office argue before judge Angulo, hoping that a favorable result might be “borrowed” by attorneys and judges in other nations with similar international commitments.

Martínez mentioned a 2005 Costa Rican rulings on leatherback turtles that later helped argue similar cases in courts in Mexico and Panama.

“If we achieve a progressive ruling, it can serve as precedent for shark finning cases in other countries,” she said.

Despite the legal progress, it’s still permitted to sell shark fins if they arrive to port naturally attached to the animals. Here and around the world, overfishing has caused a steep decline in shark populations and their slow growth and reproduction rate worry environmentalists.

“Even if fishing stopped now, their populations would need years to bounce back,” said Marviva’s Ross.

CASABLANCA - Moroccan authorities said they have foiled Sunday “one of the biggest and most dangerous” drug smuggling operations off the southwestern city of Dakhla.

Morocco’s powerful FBI-like Central Bureau of Judicial Investigation (BCIJ), said in a statement that an “unprecedented and record-breaking” quantity of cocaine was seized in a South American fishing boat registered as Zhar2 n° B-634 in Moroccan territorial waters heading to Dakhla.

The operation, which was carried out in coordination with the royal gendarmerie and the Moroccan navy, was the result of meticulous information that was gathered after tracking the activities of drug cartels which were exploiting the strategic location of the North African kingdom as their transit point for their criminal activities, said the statement.

Initial investigations led to the arrest of the mastermind of the operation and the original owner of the boat who already have previous drug-related records and are using fish exporting companies to cover up to their criminal activities.

The accused are remanded in custody pending investigation into the drug trafficking network.

BCIJ said that the magnitude and nature of the operation showed “the level of security challenges faced by Morocco so that it won’t become neither an official destination of international organised crime nor an important passage of international drug trafficking.”

The smuggling of hard drugs is part of BCIJ’s ceaseless efforts to combat criminal activities especially those related to international drug trafficking, added the statement.

Last month, the police seized 430 grams of cocaine in the northern city of Tetouan.
On June 5th, the United Nations recognizes the first International Day for the Fight against Illegal, Unreported, and Unregulated Fishing. What is IUU fishing? It’s one of the biggest problems you might not know about. IUU fishing is any fishing that violates the law, is not reported to legal and scientific authorities, or occurs in parts of the ocean not subject to fisheries management or regulations.

The UN has called on the nations of the world to end IUU fishing by 2020. But just last week, a depressing survey ranked this issue a distant last in priorities of global policy makers.

That's why today highlights the importance and urgency of ending IUU fishing. So why should you care? Here are eight of the most important reasons:

It’s fueling violent conflict around the world. Mauritanian security forces are shooting at Senegalese fishers for illegally fishing in their waters. The Ugandan army is violently cracking down on illegal fishing in Lake Victoria. And in Somalia, IUU fishing by foreign vessels has led to violent conflict with artisanal fishers and was one of the original causes of piracy in Somali waters.

It harms the poorest of the poor. A lot of IUU fishing is perpetuated by large, industrial fishing vessels that hail from distant, higher-income countries that target the waters of developing countries. These vessels are bigger, faster, and higher tech – and they have rapidly outfished artisanal vessels, leading to loss of livelihoods and nutrition in small-scale fishing communities.

It’s linked to arms and drugs smuggling. When a vessel is fishing illegally, it’s often committing other crimes. Fishing vessels found with illicit fish catches also hide caches of small arms or illegal drugs, or even evade sanctions on North Korea.

It’s linked to human slavery. Over the past few years, investigative journalists have found evidence of horrific human rights abuse – kidnapping, slavery, and murder – on fishing vessels, especially tuna and shrimp vessels in the Indian Ocean.

It costs us billions of dollars each year. IUU fishing is resource theft – and it costs the global community in lost wages, reduced export earnings, and marketplace fraud. A widely cited study estimated IUU fishing costs us over $23 billion per year – and many of those costs get passed along to consumers.

It kills endangered species like dolphins and turtles. Enforcing fisheries laws is expensive, time-consuming, difficult, and often dangerous. When illegal vessels fish as fast and furious as they can, they disregard conservation measures meant to protect vulnerable species from being snagged in unselective fishing gear. They may also target vulnerable species to feed illicit markets.

It’s destroying our ocean. When we can’t track it or count it, we can’t manage it. IUU fishing is driving the global overfishing crisis, destroying ocean habitat like coral reefs, and draining our most valuable marine fisheries.

You’re fueling it – and you don’t even know it. A fish caught illegally looks and tastes just like one caught legally. In the U.S., up to 32% of the fish we import may be a product of IUU fishing. But in the marketplace and on your plate, they are all mixed together. Better education, traceability, transparency, and enforcement are crucial to keeping illegally-caught fish off our plates.

The fight against IUU fishing brings together everything we should fight for: human rights, environmental sustainability, economic prosperity, environmental justice, and a more peaceful world. But what happens in the ocean is easily ignored.

So what can you do? Tell a friend about IUU fishing. Ask your waiter about the seafood you order and where it was caught. Write your U.S. Congressperson and ask them to support H.R. 5697, the Wildlife Conservation and Anti-Trafficking Act of 2018. Screen the film Ghost Fleet this fall to learn more about human slavery on fishing vessels. And above all, make informed and compassionate choices about the food you eat.

IUU fishing affects all of us, and it will take all of us to stop it. But a healthy dose of #OceanOptimism, growing international attention to the problem, and strong global support for the Port State Measures Agreement has us on track to win this fight once and for all.

OVERVIEW (original abstract):

Somali waters have high fisheries production potential, but the sustainability of those fisheries is compromised by the presence of foreign fishing vessels, many of them fishing illegally. The Somali domestic fishing sector is small and relatively nascent, but foreign vessels have fished in Somali waters for at least seven decades. Some foreign vessels and their crew have been a direct, physical threat to Somali artisanal fishers. Many foreign vessels directly compete for fish, reducing fish populations and destroying marine habitat through bottom trawling.

In this paper, we reconstruct foreign catch in Somali waters from 1981–2014 and classify the health of seventeen commercial fish stocks. Foreign fishing has increased more than twenty-fold since 1981, and the most rapid increase occurred during the 1990s after the collapse of the Federal government and ensuing civil war. We estimate foreign fishing vessels caught 92,500 mt of fish in 2014, almost twice that caught by the Somali domestic fleet.

Foreign IUU fishing in Somali waters is fueling public anger and perpetuating conflict in five ways:

by directly competing with the domestic fishery; through links to piracy; through nearshore illegal and destructive bottom trawling; by contributing to regional political conflict over vessel licensing; and by reducing long-term livelihood security.

Significant levels of foreign fishing combined with inconsistent governance mean Somalis are not fully benefiting from the exploitation of their marine resources at a local or national level, leading to insecurity at both scales.

Secure Fisheries’ Sarah Glaser was interviewed by Munyaradzi Makoni of Hakai Magazine for a feature about two recent Secure Fisheries reports -- Foreign Illegal, Unreported, and Unregulated Fishing in Somali Waters Perpetuates Conflict and Rough Seas: The Causes and Consequences of Fisheries Conflict in Somali Waters. The article highlights the relationship between illegal fishing and economic and political instability in the Somali region.

The article also includes comments by Shafi ‘I Hussein Muse, dean of Berbera Maritime and Fisheries Academy (a partner on Secure Fisheries’ fish catch data collection project, Project Kalluun). Muse outlines how foreign fishers are illegally catching Somali fish and that many are moving closer to Somali shores. In order to combat the problem, research to help inform Somali decision-makers and international organizations must also be coupled with action on behalf of the international community to regulate foreign fleets.
Marine Police of Coastal Security Group (CSG) have seized 25 kg of endangered sea cucumbers, protected under Schedule I of the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972, and detained a person who was carrying them to supply them to smugglers.

Acting on a tip-off, a special team, led by Inspector of Police P.S. Ramesh Kumar, launched an operation in coastal Tirupalaikudi area and detained K. Kaliappan (55), who was in possession of processed sea cucumbers.

Kaliappan was handed over to Forest Department, and Range Officer S. Ganesalingam arrested him under Sections 9, 39, 50 and 51 of the Wildlife Protection Act. He was produced before a Magistrate Court here and remanded in judicial custody. After obtaining court order, the forest officials destroyed the seized sea cucumbers.

Sub-Inspector of Police G. Ayyanar, who was part of the special team, said Kaliappan had procured the sea cucumbers from local fishermen, who inadvertently caught them while fishing.

The accused told the police that he had no direct contact with smugglers and someone would visit his house to buy the sea cucumbers. The accused had been in the illegal business for quite sometime and this was the first time he was arrested, the police said.

As fishing of sea cucumbers was banned in the country, the forest and fisheries department officials advised fishermen to let the sea cucumbers back into the sea when they caught them inadvertently. However, some fishermen sold them to smugglers to make quick money. The sea cucumbers, believed to have medicinal values, were smuggled to Malaysia, Singapore and other Southeast Asian countries, the police said.
In three different operations, Marine Police of Coastal Security Group (CSG) and Forest Department personnel seized 338 kg of endangered sea cucumbers, protected under Schedule I of the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972, and arrested one person, who procured them at the behest of smugglers.

In a pre-dawn operation, a team of Mandapam Marine Police personnel, led by Inspector P.S. Ramesh Kumar, checked vehicles on the National Highway near Mandapam, and found 250 kg of fresh sea cucumbers in an autorickshaw. The police team seized the marine species and detained the auto driver, B. Abbas (32), who had procured them at the behest of smugglers.

Mr. Ramesh Kumar said the team, comprising Sub-Inspectors of Police Rajkumar and Jothi Basu and Forest Guard Vadamalayan, was taking the seized sea cucumbers and the auto to the police station after detaining Abbas, when it received a tip-off about transportation of another consignment of sea cucumbers on Mandapam north seashore.

As the team rushed to the spot, a man who was carrying the sea cucumbers on a two-wheeler dropped them on the seashore and escaped. The team seized the bag, which contained 80 kg of fresh sea cucumbers, Mr. Kumar said.

In another operation, a team of Forest Guards seized 8 kg of sea cucumbers, also on north seashore.

Abbas was handed over to Forest Department officials, who arrested him under Sections 9, 39, 50 and 51 of the Wildlife Protection Act. He was produced before a Judicial Magistrate Court here and remanded in judicial custody. The seized sea cucumbers were destroyed on court order, Forest Range Officer S. Ganeshalingam said.

Police said the modus operandi was that the accused and others, acting at the behest of smugglers, would collect the sea cucumbers from fishermen and process them by boiling. Then they would wait for “contacts” to procure them.

The sea cucumbers, believed to have medicinal values, were smuggled to Malaysia, Singapore and other countries, the police said.
In a huge haul, Forest Department personnel seized 750 kg of sea cucumbers, protected under Schedule I of the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972, and arrested two persons, including a juvenile, who were transporting the endangered species in a van near Mandapam on Thursday.

Acting on a tip-off and an alert by Deepak S. Belgi, Wildlife Warden of Gulf of Mannar Marine National Park, a team of forest personnel led by Forest Guard A. Kalidass were checking vehicles near Indian Coast Guard Mandapam North Hovercraft Station.

When they waved a van to stop, it sped away. Six forest personnel chased the vehicle on three two-wheelers and intercepted it near Pillaimadam.

Mr. Kalidass said the driver of the van, M. Mohamed Misran (25), and a 16-year-old boy accompanying him in the van, tried to escape after stopping the vehicle, but the forest personnel overpowered them. Enquiries revealed that they procured the sea cucumbers from fishermen in Mandapam north seashore at the behest of smugglers.

The accused, hailing from Mandapam area, were assigned the task of procuring the sea cucumbers and transport them up to Perungulam near Uchipulli. They were told that a contact would collect the contraband there.

The forest personnel arrested the two under Sections 9, 39, 50 and 51 of the Wildlife Protection Act. They were produced them before Rameswaram Magistrate Court. Misran was remanded in judicial custody, and the 16-year-old boy was sent to a home for juveniles.

The seized sea cucumbers were destroyed on court orders.

This was the major catch in the recent past. Marine Police of Coastal Security Group (CSG) had seized 400 kg of sea cucumbers in two separate operations last month.
(Business in Cameroon) - Hong Da 1, a Chinese fishing vessel has just been boarded and searched in the town of Manoka, in the Cameroonian offshore. The boat, whose crew was made of locals and Asians, was immediately sent to Douala, the economic capital of the country.

According to information given by the national navy, this vessel, which had not yet any catch, was probably getting ready to fish less than 5km away from the coast, a zone legally dedicated to traditional and non-industrial fishing. Additionally, we learned, the fishing boat was getting dangerously close to the sub-marine cable SAT3, whose deployment led to a navigation ban in this area.

According to one authorised source, it was even Camtel, historical telecoms operator and operating this cable who, thanks to a monitoring system, detected the presence of the vessel along the Cameroonian coast and seized the national navy to board and search it.

Abalone poachers’ network spread far and wide

Cape Town - When police found 8 397 shucked abalone in the garage of Warrant Officer Daniel October’s house they called him at the Gansbaai Police Station. As they watched the abalone slime drip from a car parked in October’s garage, they asked him to unlock his garage. He refused. They sent a policeman to fetch him, but he wouldn’t budge. They eventually arrested him at the police station. Read: ‘All that was left of one diver was a pelvic bone’ October is one of five policemen standing trial with 20 others accused in a racketeering case involving one of the biggest abalone syndicates in the country in the Western Cape High Court.

It is believed the syndicate has 700 members. They allegedly smuggled abalone worth R2 billion, poaching an average of 1.1 ton a day over a 13-year period between 1998 and 20011.

The State accuses October of making abalone dockets “disappear”.

Jan De Waal testified the crew “dressed in October’s house” – putting on their wetsuits, 300 bar nitrogyn-oxygen diving tanks and weightbelts.

De Waal said, “a police bakkie picked up abalone in the old harbour”.

October’s friend, Sergeant Jody Behr, worked for the police for 15 years – seven years at Napier and eight at Stanford.

The court was told he freelanced for the syndicate, but later left the police to join the syndicate full-time in 2004.

According to the State, Behr “occasionally” fetched money from the alleged Chinese mastermind of the syndicate, Ran Wei, to pay poachers.

Behr was once caught carrying R400 000 in cash which he claimed belonged to local syndicate leader Frank Barends, who allegedly sold the abalone to Ran.

Lieutenant Colonel Lise Potgieter, leader of the police team that crushed the syndicate, testified that “Behr was caught with the money and the money is Frank’s”.

A member of her team, Captain Danie Rautenbach, told the court Behr was the syndicate’s “operational group manager” while syndicate members testified he drove ahead of the rest of the crew.

De Waal remembered the day he found out Behr was a cop. “He took out his badge and showed me he’s actually a policeman. I got the fright of my life . I was thinking: ‘Oh my God, this guy is working for us. We’re nicely pushed into the jaws of the shark’.”

Another policeman, Johannes “Koppe” Jacobs who worked at the Gansbaai and Stanford police stations was arrested and found guilty for issuing firearms to the same syndicate.

He was in charge of the divers, weighing the abalone, paying the divers and selling the perlemoen.

Five witnesses pointed Jacobs out as the scaleman.

De Waal testified that, “Koppe... he was always the guy who paid and who weighed.”

And 500km north, the syndicate had two policemen working for them in Beaufort West.

Warrant Officer Frank Maritz and Sergeant Clive Booysen made sure the perlemoen got to Joburg, safely into the hands of Ran, who smuggled it to China.

The crime boss is on the run after skipping South Africa in 2010 and is wanted by Interpol.

Maritz used his police van to fetch poachers at a truck stop about 15km outside Beaufort West while Booysen used a small blue bakkie, a gift from the syndicate leaders.

At the truck stops Maritz and Booysen took cash bribes of R6 000 from the poachers. This ensured safe passage through the town.

Poacher and State witness Carlo Adams said: “Police drove in front and if something is wrong in town, they phone and said: ‘Okay, we’re going this side or that side”.

Witness and poacher Jonty Adonis said police led him through the town twice a week.

Another poacher, Barend van Vuuren, testified they escorted him at least 11 times while en route to Joburg and twice to Cape Town.

Undercover agents trapped Booysen. He accepted a R6 000 bribe from poacher Edward Jaftha to allow 80kg of abalone through the town. October is still at the Gansbaai police station and Maritz at Beaufort West.

But they don’t do much police work. Since 2014 they’ve spent most of their time in court.

Cape Town – Abalone with an estimated street value of R950 000 was seized following a high-speed sea chase in Hout Bay in the early hours of Friday morning, Western Cape police said.

Police spokeswoman Noloyiso Rwexana said officers from the Cape Town sea border unit, the special task force and the department of agriculture, fisheries and forestry conducted a joint operation after they received a tip-off about possible poaching that was taking place at Robben Island.

“A vessel was spotted entering Hout Bay Harbour this [Friday] morning about 04:00, without any navigational lights,” said Rwexana.

“The poaching vessel spotted the law enforcement vessels and sped off into Hout Bay harbour.”

The crew abandoned the vessel by jumping onto the quayside and “disappeared among the factories”, she said.
Abalone worth R6m seized in Cape Town

Share this article: Share Tweet Share Share Share Email Share

Cape Town - More than R6 million worth of abalone has been confiscated by authorities so far this month as the scourge of abalone poaching continues in the Western Cape. In the latest incident, two foreign nationals were arrested and charged with contravening sections of the Living Marine Resources Act after more than R4.5m worth of abalone was found in their possession. Members of the Hawks, the police’s K9 unit and the Department of Fisheries and Forestry made the arrest on Tuesday in Gordon’s Bay. The two men, a Chinese national, 23, and a Zimbabwean national, 28, were found in a house the Hawks believed was used as an illegal abalone processing facility. Authorities seized equipment and over 26 015 units of abalone worth millions. Hawks spokesman, Lloyd Ramovha, said: “We shall continue to dismantle laboratories in intensified endeavours to rid our coastlines of this scourge.”

The pair are expected to appear in the Strand Magistrate's Court on Thursday.

Earlier this month, police arrested two men transporting more than R800 000 worth of abalone.

Meanwhile, Chinese nationals Han Ran and Zhao Huirm were sentenced to 18 months imprisonment and fined R500 000 at the Khayelitsha Priority Crimes court for smuggling abalone and cultivating dagga. The two, aged 31 and 35 respectively, were arrested earlier in the year. They were alleged to have been operating an abalone holding on the outskirts of Langebaan. They were also accused of running a processing facility.

More than 37 936 units of dried abalone and five units of wet shucked abalone were confiscated during the arrest.

Last week, DA standing committee chair on economic opportunities, tourism and agriculture, Beverley SchÃ¤fer, said abalone poaching has had a devastating effect on local coastal communities and businesses.

She said that gangsters attracted to poaching are making their way into communities with young people being coerced into drug abuse and prostitution.

“Poachers are no longer paid in cash but in drugs,” Schafer said.

She said the Hawks were achieving some success in prosecuting rackets, but they were nowhere near alleviating the problem.

Lately, frequent seizures of banned marine species, especially sea cucumbers are reported along the southern Tamil Nadu coast, mainly from Tuticorin and Ramanathapuram districts. These sea cucumbers are caught in bulk and smuggled to neighbouring countries from the marine biodiversity rich Gulf of Mannar seas, where they fetch a good price.

According to official sources, sea cucumber poaching and processing happens across the coast and the seizures are just a tip of the iceberg. "Not even 10% of the smuggled sea cucumbers are seized by the various enforcement authorities," said a marine police official.

Till July 2001, traditional fishermen used to catch the sea cucumbers by skin diving and sell them to local traders. It was a source of income for thousands of fishermen along the coast since they are found in plenty in the region. "After the ban, the trade shifted from fishermen to smugglers who control the business in this region. They operate like a mafia," the official said.

Wildlife warden of Gulf of Mannar Marine National Park, Deepak Bilgi said that indiscriminate poaching of marine species like sea cucumber and seahorse forced the central government to include them in Schedule I. Poaching them is punishable under Wildlife Protection Act and they are keeping a close watch for smugglers, he said.

However, since sea cucumbers are not banned in the neighbouring countries, smugglers transport processed ones either by sea or road from where they are sent especially to far eastern countries where there is a greater demand.

Experts on the other hand question the logic behind the ban which they say is not serving its purpose. Retired principal scientist of Central Marine Fisheries Research Institute, H Mohammed Kasim said the forest department that implemented about the ban does not have any enforcement capability on seas where the sea cucumbers are harvested. "The forest department does not have the infrastructure to curb poachers or expertise to research on sea cucumbers. We are clueless on what expertise the department included sea cucumber into protected marine species," he said.

Fishermen said they don't consider sea cucumbers as endangered species. "In our experience, we have seen sea cucumbers multiplying once in six months. They are plenty in sea in spite of rampant smuggling. We have only lost sustainable livelihood by this ban," said Arul Rayappan, a fisherman in Pamban.

Sea cucumber

Sea cucumbers are echinoderms, marine animals with cylindrical shape living on the ocean floor

There are more than 1,700 species distributed across the world but more in Asia Pacific region

In India, they are protected as Schedule I species under the Wildlife Protection Act and fishing them from sea bottom is banned

They are widely used in cuisines of far eastern countries and is in high demand for Chinese traditional medicine

They are poached predominantly in Gulf of Mannar where they are found in large numbers and smuggled through sea to Sri Lanka where it is not banned

They act like scavengers of ocean floor feeding through filter and excessive poaching will hurt marine eco-system

The smuggling of sea cucumbers

Sea cucumbers near the shore are caught by local fishermen by skin diving while there is a specific net that can be used in fishing trawlers to catch them away from the shore

People employed by smugglers using a small boat collect the sea cucumbers before fishing trawlers come to the shore

The harvested sea cucumbers are boiled in hot water added with salt and later dried on the shore called processing

After thorough drying, 1 kg of sea cucumbers shrink to just 200g. They are packed and transported either through sea or by road

Since sea cucumbers are banned only in India, transporting to neighbouring countries either by road or sea is the modus operandi of smugglers

Sri Lanka is the main transit point through sea where one kg of processed sea cucumber can fetch INR 5,000. Smugglers procure the same amount to less than Rs 1000 in the region

The total seizures may not even account to 10% of the total sea cucumbers smuggled

Collaboration with our international counterparts is an important part of successful fisheries management. Australian Fisheries Management Authority (AFMA) Fisheries Officers routinely conduct joint patrols to help combat the global issue of illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing.

From 21 November to 15 December 2016 two AFMA fisheries officers joined the French Navy on a three week fisheries patrol on board the B2M D’Entrecasteaux, a multi-purpose French Naval Vessel based in Noumea, New Caledonia.

The main aim of the patrol was to investigate the recent sightings of vessels fishing illegally in the vicinity of Chesterfield Reef located to the western edge of New Caledonia’s Exclusive Economic Zone, about 200 nautical miles east of Gladstone.

Combined aerial surveillance provided by France, the Australian Border Force, and the New Zealand Defence Force detected 3 vessels suspected of illegally taking sea cucumber. In a coordinated operation with Australian maritime authorities, one of these vessels was apprehended in the Australian Exclusive Economic Zone by the Royal Australian Navy vessel HMAS Pirie on 30 November (see Vietnamese fishing vessel apprehended near Saumarez Reef).

Later that week, BM2 D’Entrecasteaux on return to Chesterfield Reef (in French waters), boarded a Vietnamese fishing vessel that was alleged to be conducting illegal diving operations on the reef. Upon inspection it was found to have approximately 3.5 tonnes of processed sea cucumber on board. As a result the French authorities seized all the vessels catch and fishing gear.

The success of this patrol illustrates the high level of regional cooperation that exists between Australia, France and New Zealand. For more information on how Australia is combatting IUU fishing go to afma.gov.au.
Belize-flagged ship hauled in for fishing violations in Somalia

Dec 2, 2016

A shipping vessel tonight remains in the custody of the government of the African country of Somalia for illegal fishing activities. But what does the detention have to do with Belize? Well, the Geko 1 was detained while flying the Belize flag which means that it is registered in Belize and the incident can potentially give the local registry a black eye. The vessel which is owned by a Greek company was recently seized with a cargo of approximately thirty tons of high value fish harvested in Somali waters. Aside from breaking international fishing laws, the vessel is also suspected of using a fraudulent Somali license. The state-run registry, IMMARBE, is attempting to clear up the mess with authorities in the African continent. News Five’s Isani Cayetano reports.

Isani Cayetano, Reporting

Illegal fishing, aside from piracy, remains a primary concern for maritime law enforcement globally. In Belizean waters, there have been numerous reports of Guatemalan fishermen unlawfully harvesting our marine resources. Oddly enough, the shoe is on the other foot, except that it involves a Greek-owned vessel and a crew of men who have never set foot on Belizean soil or sailed our high seas. The Greko 1, a trawler operating illegally within Somali waters, flies the Belizean standard, after receiving permission from the International Merchant Marine Registry of Belize two years ago. Tonight, it is grounded in Mombasa, the chief seaport of Kenya.

Valerie Lanza, Director, High Seas Fisheries

“It was recently detained by Somali government because it was suspected of engaging in illegal activities within Somali jurisdiction. So the Somali government contacted us and we have been in communication with them, as well as the government of Mombasa in regards to the allegations that were made of illegal fishing. Some of the allegations that were made, for us, were questionable considering the economic situation in Somalia. But we have worked with the owners, we have worked with the Mombasa government, with the Somali government and at present we have come to a resolution of the allegations.”

So how does a watercraft owned by a Greek company, registered with IMMARBE and permitted to fly the Belizean flag, end up in custody off the coast of Africa?

Valerie Lanza

“The vessel has been registered with us since 2014. It has been operating in Somali waters under license from the Somali government for that time and what we believed happened was that in 2014, the Somalis revised their fisheries law and certain legislations were changed in regards to what type of foreign-owned vessel can operate in their jurisdiction. The Greko 1 unfortunately, was one of those vessels that were, their fishing gears were prohibited from operating within that area and it came under investigation by Somali government. The Somali government basically told us that the licenses that they had given back in 2014 to this vessel was fraudulent. So there was a lot of back and forth communication with the Somali government regarding these so-called fraudulent permits that were given by their administration.”

During that time however, Greko 1 fled from Mogadishu and subsequent bulletins were issued to countries within the region, including Kenya, Madagascar and Mozambique. Those countries all closed their ports to the fugitive vessel.

Valerie Lanza

“The owners basically are in communication with Somali government right now to resolve the case. They were issued with a sanction. The sanction was reduced because the owners agreed to, made an agreement with them to pay a portion of that sanction after they discharge whatever cargo was onboard their vessel in Mombasa. From our understanding, the payment has been made to Somali. The Somali government has yet to contact us to confirm that that payment has been received. But the vessel is currently located in Mombasa where it has been prohibited from sailing by Belize, its license has been suspended until we receive confirmation from Somalia that the case has been closed.”

Prior to the trawler taking flight, an inspection of its cargo space revealed that the hold was filled to capacity with approximately thirty tons of high value frozen fish, arguably worth more than the vessel itself. Will the Government of Belize, IMMARBE’s new owner face any sanctions in light of Greko 1’s illegal exploits?

Valerie Lanza

“We have our legislation that governs this type of activities and we took actions when we heard about the allegations. Like I said, we contacted the Somali government. The actions that we took was prohibiting the vessel from sailing and restricting or suspending its license. So at this time the vessel doesn’t have a license to operate and it’s currently located in Mombasa where it remains until we give the permission that it could continue its operation.”

Greko 1 had been facing fines of up to six hundred thousand U.S. dollars for violations of Somali Fisheries Law. This is the first case that has made it unto the media blotter since government compulsorily acquired IMMARBE in 2013.

Cape Town - Police swooped on a house in Pelican Heights, Grassy Park, seizing dried abalone worth several million rand, Western Cape police said on Thursday.

Police spokeswoman Noloyiso Rwexana said police received a tip-off about possible illegal activity at the house in Osprey street before they pounced and discovered the premises were being used as an abalone processing facility.

“Two large steel pots, still filled with fluid from cooking, were in one of the rooms, while various items of equipment were found in a second room. A third room, the drying room, had numerous shelves and plastic crates filled with thousands of units of dried abalone,” said Rwexana.

“In the garage the members found a Hyundai panel van filled with crates of dried abalone. In addition to the abalone and vehicle, numerous items of equipment were seized which include, among other, the cooking pots, gas cylinders and burners, fans, drying shelves and a scale.”

While the exact value of the abalone would only be determined after it had been counted and weighed by the department of agriculture, forestry and fisheries, police estimate it could be in the region of “quite a few million rands”.
It’s not just the South China Sea — Chinese fishing vessels have been accused of illegal activities all over the world.

The Indonesian Navy intercepted a Chinese vessel that was caught illegally fishing in Indonesian territory off the Natuna Islands on Saturday, June 18. Indonesian Navy spokesman First Admiral Edi Sucipto said the seven crew members of the Chinese vessel were detained. This is the third incident in the Natuna Islands involving Chinese vessels.

A statement from the Chinese Foreign Ministry confirmed that the Indonesian navy had fired warning shots at a Chinese vessel, injuring one Chinese fisherman and damaging the boat. However, China emphasized that the waters in question are regarded as “China’s traditional fishing grounds,” and accused Indonesia of an “abused of force.”

For its part, Indonesia has said it will continue to take “decisive” action against foreign ships operating illegally in its waters after the comments from Beijing. “We will not hesitate to take decisive action against foreign ships, whatever their flag and nationality, when they commit violations in Indonesian territory,” Sucipto said.

This is not the first time China has infringed on a foreign exclusive economic zone (EEZ). Chinese fishing vessels have in recent years made some very audacious incursion into foreign EEZs. In part, this has been due to the Chinese government asserting its ambiguous nine-dash line claim in the South China Sea. But incursions have also happened farther afield too.

In May, South Africa detained three Chinese ships and approximately 100 crew members on suspicion of illegal squid fishing in its EEZ without permits. The three vessels — Fu Yuan Yu 7880, Fu Yang Yu 7881, and Run Da 617 — had a combined total of almost 600 tonnes of squid when the navy escorted them to shore, according to Reuters.

“We cannot tolerate the plundering of our marine resources, which are a source of food security,” Agriculture and Fisheries Minister Senzeni Zokwana said in a statement. “We are also looking into the sudden influx of these vessels in our waters.”

The three vessels, part of a fleet of six 55-meter ocean-going fishing vessels officially registered in Fuzhou, have been caught red handed in foreign waters without licenses before. In January, the NGO Sea Shepherd encountered the fleet in the Indian Ocean, west of Perth in Western Australia. These vessels, as logged and reported by Sea Shepherd, were using driftnets, which have been banned by the UN since 1992 and are known to kill marine life indiscriminately. The Sea Shepherd gave pursuit and followed the fleet for two months into the South China Sea. On March 23, just north of the disputed Spratly Islands, Fu Yuan Yu 076 requested protection from a patrolling Chinese warship.

“We were called by Chinese Naval warship 571 and asked to explain our activities,” says Captain of the Steve Irwin, Siddharth Chakravarty. Surprisingly, the PLA Navy allowed the Steve Irwin to continue its pursuit.

In March, Argentina’s coast guard sank a Chinese trawler illegally fishing in Argentinian waters after the Chinese vessel attempted to ram the coast guard boat. Earlier this month, South Korea and the UN Command in Korea began a joint operation specifically targeting Chinese fishing vessels operating illegally off the west coast of South Korea. Tensions have been high since the 2011 murder of a South Korean coast guard officer by the Chinese crew of an illegal fishing vessel.

China is, by far, the world’s largest “producer” of fish. The term “producer” reflects the reported number of tonnes of marine fish captured. In the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations’ 2014 “World Review of Fisheries and Aquaculture,” China recorded 13.9 million tonnes of marine fish; its closest competitor was Indonesia at 5.4 million tonnes. It is unclear if illegal hauls are included in these figures. Globally, illegal fishing costs the global industry around $23 billion each year.

In his 2005 book China and International Fisheries Law and Policy, Xue Guifang said three factors contribute to low compliance with international fishing agreements by Chinese fishermen. Many do not comprehend the changes to fishing waters stipulated in these agreements, meaning fishermen are now restricted from areas where they were previously able to fish without hassle. Another factor might be the poor technology many of the fishing boats carry, which do not properly identify their exact coordinates. However, the vast majority of infractions are driven by the economic incentives for illegally entering extraterritorial seas. Lastly, Xue says Chinese fisheries officials fall far short in the experience, capability, and determination needed to police foreign EEZ regimes.

Gary Stokes, director of Sea Shepherd Southeast Asia, is looking at the situation optimistically. Stokes told the South China Morning Post that there is a need to take a soft approach with China. In recent years, the Chinese government has appeared to be more proactive in the policing of illegal fishing. “Maybe China is taking this issue seriously, or at least they are following the law, which in itself is encouraging,” said Stokes.
Ficksburg - South African police at the Peka border post with Lesotho arrested two suspects after stopping a vehicle with abalone and illegal wine, and then arrested two more who arrived on the scene and tried to bribe the officials.





Police spokesperson, Captain Phumelelo Dhlamini, said that on Tuesday at about 3pm members of the Peka Port of Entry were conducting routine searches of vehicles, when they stopped a Mercedes Benz vehicle with two men inside.

“Upon searching the vehicle, the members found two sealed plastic bags containing dry abalone weighing 1,75 kilogrammes, with the street value of R8,650, as well as 10 x 750ml illegal wine bottles wrapped inside baby nappies.”

Dhlamini said the suspects were arrested for failing to produce any legal documents or licence to trade in abalone.

According to police, after the arrest of the two suspects, two other men arrived at the border post and tried to bribe the officials by offering them R10,000 in exchange for the release of the two suspects that had been arrested earlier.

“The members refused to accept the bribe and took the bribers into custody. All the suspects will appear before the Ficksburg Magistrate’s Court, charged with bribery of police officials, illegal possession of abalone and illegal food and wine.”

At least 45 people with suspected links to drug trafficking have been killed in four days since Rodrigo Duterte was sworn in as president of the Philippines, according to authorities.

ABS-CBN, the Philippines' largest TV channel, reported on Monday that at least 29 drug and robbery suspects were killed in Bulacan province, near the capital Manila, since June 30, when Duterte took over the presidency .

Authorities said the suspects resisted arrest and shot at police officers.

Nine other killings were reported in Manila.

Duterte won the election in May on a platform of crushing crime. But his rhetoric has alarmed many who hear echoes of the country's authoritarian past.

After his oathtaking on Thursday, Duterte said he wanted to get rid of drug traffickers, telling supporters to "go ahead and kill them yourself as getting their parents to do it would be too painful".

Duterte's top police commander, Ronald dela Rosa, also told officers accused of drug links that he would not hesitate to change their birthdays to November 2, referring to the Day of the Dead, a major religious holiday in Catholic Philippines.

In Manila, Oscar Albayalde, regional police chief, said five drug dealers were killed on Sunday in a gun battle with police in a shantytown near the Malacanang presidential residence.

Rodrigo Duterte: Shoot a drug dealer, get a medal

"My men were about to serve arrest warrants when shots rang out from one of the houses in the area," Albayalde told reporters, saying police returned fire and killed five men.

Four guns and 200g of crystal methamphetamine were recovered, police added.

Two other men were shot dead in separate sting operations in the Pasig district.

Two bodies were also found under a well-known Manila bridge on Saturday morning. Their faces were bound with duct tape and their shirts bore signs in Filipino saying "Don't follow my example. I am a pusher".

A local reporter posted a photo of the bodies on Facebook.

Elsewhere, at least six alleged drug dealers and a policeman linked to drugs syndicates were killed in six other provinces across the country.

Media reports said more than 100 people had already died, mostly suspected drug dealers, rapists and car thieves, since Duterte's election win on May 9.

Azadeh Shahshahani, a human rights lawyer who has monitored rights abuses in the Philippines, told Al Jazeera that the killings set a "worrisome trend" in light of the comments issued by Duterte.

"The president and his subordinates should remember that the accused should be afforded a fair process in an independent court of law regardless of the severity of the offence, per well-established principles of international law," Shahshahani, a director of the US-based group Project South, said.

Edre Olalia, secretary-general of the Manila-based National Union of People's Lawyers, also said the killings must stop.

"The drug menace must stop. Yet the apparent serial summary executions of alleged street-drug users or petty-drug lords, which appear sudden, too contrived and predictable, must also stop," he said in a statement to the Reuters news agency.

"The two are not incompatible."

In the northern province of Cagayan, officials said $19.23m worth of drugs from either China or Taiwan were seized on Monday.

The shipment was unloaded at sea and brought to shore by small fishing boats before delivery to Manila's Chinatown, according to Dela Rosa.

On Sunday, the communist armed group New People's Army issued a statement supporting Duterte's all-out war against drugs, saying it might conduct its own drug operations against soldiers, police and local officials.

News

Eight local fishermen who were engaging in illegal fishing at two separate locations arrested by Navy yesterday. Accordingly, 6 persons who engaged in illegal fishing practices in the seas off Kaluwankerni using unauthorized nets were arrested by the naval personnel attached to SLNS Kashyapa located in Vakarai in the Eastern Naval Command.

Along with the suspects, 2 dinghies and 2 monofilament nets used for fishing activities were taken into naval custody. The apprehended fishermen and their belongings were handed over to the Assistant Directorate of Fisheries in Batticaloa for further investigations.

On the same day, naval personnel attached to SLNS Barana located in Mullikulam in the North Western Naval Command arrested another 2 local fishermen with 2 dinghies and 2 monofilament nets, while fishing illegally in the seas off Kolankanaththa. The arrested persons long with the fishing gear were produced to the Assistant Directorate of Fisheries in Puttalam for onward action.
Illegal fishing boats are being used by people smugglers promising to transport asylum seekers to countries including New Zealand.

Thirty four Indian and Nepalese asylum seekers have been taken off Vietnamese boats in the Federated States of Micronesia.

Currently in the capital Pohnpei, they told One News they had paid agents in Indonesia up to US$30,000 each to get them to New Zealand, Australia and the US.

FSM Chief litigator Clayton Lawrence said he is currently working with the Indian government to get them home.

"They went through the United Nations High Commission on refugees process they have been assessed and only four out of the 34 were in fact found to be refugees," he said.

Officials here are extremely unhappy at the Vietnamese Government which is refusing to take responsibility for its flagged vessels.

In the last two years nine Vietnamese boats have 135 people have been arrested in FSM for plundering the reef and lagoon areas targeting sea cucumbers and shark fins.

Officials suspect it’s just the tip of the iceberg and are extremely concerned at the trend which is having a direct impact on locals.

Head of fishing Eugene Pangelinan says Vietnam needs to step up to the plate as a responsible player in the community, control their nations and prosecute them.

"This is stealing from the people in the FSM particularly in the outer regions so they should be stopped," he said.

The cost to FSM has run into hundreds of thousands of dollars as it’s had to pay for patrol boat costs, and food and support for the Vietnamese. Some of those arrested and sent home have returned back at a later date to do the same thing again.

Government to sink some 30 foreign vessels for illegal fishing

Jakarta (ANTARA News) - The Marine and Fishery Ministry will sink dozens of foreign vessels detained for conducting illegal fishing in the Indonesian waters.



"Early in July, we will sink some 30 foreign ships," Minister of Marine Affairs and Fisheries Susi Pudjiastuti stated here during a conference on Tuesday.



Minister Pudjiastuti emphasized that the government did not grant special privileges to any country as it equally treated all vessels found conducting illegal fishing in Indonesia.



Several foreign vessels had been detained on suspicion of conducting illegal fishing activities in the Indonesian territory.



Recently, on June 15-16, the government had detained four Vietnamese-flagged vessels and two Philippines-flagged ships for trespassing the border and allegedly conducting illegal fishing in the countrys waters.



Meanwhile, on June 12, the governments Orca 003 Surveillance Vessel intercepted seven other Vietnamese-flagged ships, weighing between 60 to 100 gross tonnage, with its 55 crew members, in Indonesias exclusive economic zone in the Natuna waters, Riau Islands.



Indonesia has been taking key steps in line with the trend of sustainable fishery management policies, including the efforts to fight illegal, unregulated, and unreported (IUU) fishing practices.



Despite the governments policy of detonating and sinking illegal foreign fishing vessels, the authorities continue to encounter ships trespassing into and poaching in the Indonesian waters.



The Indonesian government has, since October 2014, sunk at least 151 foreign ships caught conducting illegal fishing practices in the countrys waters, Pudjiastuti revealed.



The vessels involved in IUU fishing that were sunk comprised 50 ships from Vietnam, 43 from the Philippines, 21 from Thailand, 20 from Malaysia, two from Papua New Guinea, and one from China.



The government has also sunk 14 Indonesian-flagged ships involved in IUU fishing.(*)
PUNTA GORDA, Mon. Oct. 17, 2016–Six Belizeans were held by the Guatemalan Armed Forces (GAF) today after they allegedly invaded Belizean waters and towed the petrified Belizeans for hours in southern waters, warning them that the GAF would begin to assert themselves in waters which the fishermen know to be their traditional fishing grounds.

Whereas the Guatemalans are claiming that the Belizeans were found in Guatemalan waters, Eric “Ricky” Foster, 33, a fisherman and farmer of Punta Gorda, Toledo, told Amandala tonight that he was well inside Belizean territory. He told us that other residents of Punta Gorda saw the Guatemalan vessels nearby as well.

Foster said that he was abducted near Moho Caye, north of Punta Gorda, by Guatemalan military traveling in a Columbian skiff and a Guatemala-flagged gunboat, which had two other confiscated Belizean fishing vessels in tow.

Foster said that when he first saw the vessels approaching so near to Punta Gorda Town, he thought that it was the Belize Coast Guard, and when he realized that it was the Guatemalan military, he called a friend, asking him to alert Wil Maheia, of the Belize Territorial Volunteers, of what was unfolding.

Maheia messaged us this afternoon, around the same time that the Chief Executive Officer in the Ministry of National Security, Felix Enriquez, was also receiving notification of what had happened.

Earlier today, after the news first broke, Amandala was informed that the matter was being addressed through diplomatic channels. Our efforts to get comment from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs today were unsuccessful.

Tonight, the Government of Belize issued a formal statement confirming that “six (6) Belizeans were detained earlier this afternoon by a Guatemalan coastal patrol vessel, while they were fishing in the Gulf of Honduras.”

“The Guatemalan coastal patrol vessel intercepted the Belizeans in an area at sea at a point between the mouth of the Moho River, Toledo District, Belize, and Punta de Manabique, Izabal, Guatemala. The Guatemalan Navy claimed that the Belizeans were illegally fishing in Guatemala,” the release added.

It said that, “After prompt intervention and coordination by Belizean diplomatic and military officials, along with their Guatemalan counterparts, the Belizeans were thereafter released and returned to the location where they were first encountered.”

We were able to speak with Foster after the Belizeans were released this evening. He told Amandala that he went fishing at about 8:00 this morning at his usual spot near, a few miles from Punta Gorda. He told us that he usually dives for conch and lobster, and he also fishes for finfish. Foster was accompanied by a diver.

He said that within the hour, he saw two other boats being towed behind a gun boat, and they were joined by a Columbian skiff with officers of the Guatemalan armed forces: 7 males and 1 female.

“This is Guatemalan waters,” Foster said they told him.

“They said they will enforce that,” claiming that fishing by Belizeans would not be allowed beyond 3 miles, Foster said.

By the time the Guatemalans got to Foster, they had already held an elderly fisherman (Mr. Thompson) and his wife, who were in one fishing boat; as well as Herson Coleman and another fisher; who were in a third boat.

“They took our phone, money, and rubbed us down,” he said.

He told us that they were towed by the Guatemalans around the waters from about 9:00 a.m. to about 4:00 p.m., after which they were returned to Belize.

They were taken near Puerto Barrios but not taken ashore; instead, the gun boat, which paraded them through the southern waters of Belize, turned around and brought them back via the Sarstoon, he recounted.

“I thought they were going to kill us,” said Foster, who told us that he felt threatened during the ordeal.

They were given water but nothing to eat, Foster said.

“The [elderly] lady nearly caught a heart attack,” he said.

“They told us this is a warning…” he added.

Foster told us that this was the closest to Punta Gorda Town that people have seen the Guatemalan military come.

Concerned over the latest developments, fishermen there are planning to meet tomorrow, said Foster.

“While we are fighting each other, Guatemala is taking over our country,” he said.

He told us that there were 5 skiffs with Maya Indians fishing in the area, but none of them were stopped – only those skiffs with Creole and “Cooley” fishers, Foster said.

Pointing to the land rights ruling in favor of the Maya of Toledo, he said: “The Maya have the west and Guatemala is now taking the east… What will Black men do?”

He said that he is unable to expand his farm in Toledo due to the communal land rights ruling, which has affirmed customary land tenure across nearly 40 villages in Toledo.

“Mawga dawg will eat di food… I can’t get no land; I can’t go fish. Guatemala deh right front ah me,” said Foster.

He is calling for the Belize National Teachers’ Union (BNTU), which is continuing into its third week of strike action, to put the Guatemala issue on their agenda.

“The enemy di close in pan we…” said Foster, who said that he is stifling in his own country.

CEO Enriquez told us that Belizean authorities will be looking into the matter, and trying to ascertain where exactly the Belizeans were held by the Guatemalans.

Guatemalans posted a video last Friday, October 14, on the Facebook page, Belice es Nuestro, of GAF military aggressively chasing Belizeans from the Sarstoon area.

In May 2016, the GAF detained 8 Belizean fishers for illegal entry at Punta Manabique Beach in Izabal, Guatemala, and they were safely returned after official intervention, but their boat was confiscated.

Last March, the Guatemalan military detained nearly 40 Belizeans who had traveled to the Sarstoon as a part of an expedition led by the Northern Territorial Volunteers, likewise claiming that they had entered into Guatemalan waters.

Usually, the troubles between Belize and Guatemala are limited to skirmishes on the Sarstoon, and we are told that official talks have yet to be concluded to establish a mechanism for engagement on our southern border. However, the recent developments add a new dimension to the problems faced by Belizeans in our southern waters.
Joint media release: Immigration and Border Protection and the Australian Fisheries Management Authority

In a major hit to illegal fishing in Australian waters, Maritime Border Command (MBC) within the Australian Border Force (ABF) and the Australian Fisheries Management Authority (AFMA) have apprehended a foreign fishing vessel on Thursday 22 September 2016.

The Australian Defence Vessel (ADV) Cape Byron boarded a Papua New Guinea (PNG) registered fishing vessel about 2.9nm inside the Australian Economic Exclusion Zone (AEEZ), west of Thursday Island.

The vessel was initially identified by HMAS Adelaide on Monday 19 September and was seen crossing into the AEEZ by an MBC surveillance aircraft on Thursday.

Officers from Cape Byron boarded the vessel and located 500 kilograms of fresh fish and about 9 tons of fish in freezer compartments.

The 29 people on board the fishing vessel were detained and will be brought to Australia for further investigation by the Australian Fisheries Management Authority (AFMA).

Commander Maritime Border Command, Rear Admiral Peter Laver praised the joint efforts of Maritime Border Command and the Australian Fisheries Management Authority and said the apprehensions highlight the capability of both agencies.

“I command a world-class fleet of ABF and the Australian Defence Force (ADF) maritime surveillance and response assets for this work. We are monitoring our waters 24/7 and are highly responsive to any sign of illegal activity,” Rear Admiral Laver said.

“Australia’s maritime domain exceeds 10 million square kilometres, but no matter where these boats are, MBC and AFMA officers will continue to work tirelessly to ensure that Australia’s waters remain free from illegal fishing.”

AFMA’s General Manager Fisheries Operations, Peter Venslovas, agreed saying the continued joint efforts of MBC and AFMA ensures Australia’s marine resources are protected from poachers and remain healthy.

“Australia’s well managed Commonwealth fisheries are tempting for foreign fishing vessels. It is the continued cooperation between AFMA and MBC that ensures poachers will be caught,”

“Those attempting to steal from our marine environments should be on notice – they will be caught.”

This apprehension comes a day after 16 foreign fisherman from Vietnam were convicted of illegal fishing within Australian waters, receiving suspended sentences and their vessel was confiscated by AFMA and destroyed.

Illegal fishing vessel held in Cape Town harbour

Share this article: Share Tweet Share Share Share Email Share

Cape Town - A late-night sea chase off the Eastern Cape involving Chinese fishing vessels which switched off their navigational equipment to try to flee undetected ended with a vessel being caught and escorted to Cape Town. The vessel, which was illegally in South Africa waters, was brought into harbour on Saturday. It will remain docked here. It has nine crewmen on board who are not allowed on land as they do not have the necessary documentation. Read: Suspected illegal fishing vessels in SA waters The nine other vessels which escaped regrouped in South African waters on Saturday just outside an exclusive zone – the navy was briefed to help chase them if necessary. Neighbouring areas, including the governments of Namibia and Mozambique, have been put on high alert in case the vessels enter their waters. The arrested vessel, the Lu Huang Yuan Yu 186, was detected off the Eastern Cape along with the others on Thursday. These were sailing at a speed which would not have enabled them to fish and the reason why the vessels were in South African waters illegally is being investigated.

A source linked to the vessels said the drama was a result of a simple misunderstanding. “The only fault was that the captain didn’t know about the rules of the borderline that they needed permission to pass through.”

Owners of the Lu Huang Yuan Yu 186 face charges for illegally entering the South African Exclusive Economic Zone and for disobeying lawful instructions by a fishery control inspector. Crew were not helpful when inspectors asked to come on board. So the inspectors were forced to leap on to the ship.

On Thursday members of the Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries detected the fleet of vessels around Port Edward heading towards Bird Island, a marine protected area near Port Elizabeth.

The vessels were sailing from China to Congo, where crew apparently had permits to fish. A patrol vessel from the department was sent to intercept the vessels, but bad weather made it unsafe for inspectors to launch a boat. Inspectors questioned the crew via radio.

The crew had not notified the fisheries department they would be moving through SA waters. They had not applied for permits either.

Police were investigating the inhumane keeping of dogs on the vessel and Sars issued a R8 000 fine for cigarette and tobacco-related matters.

Weekend Argus
Illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing does not respect rules adopted at either the national or international level. It threatens economic growth, food security, and ocean ecosystems around the world by undermining sustainable fisheries and the law-abiding fishers and communities that depend on them. IUU fishing can take on many forms, ranging from small-scale vessels misreporting their catch or straying into a neighboring country’s waters, to coordinated efforts by transnational crime syndicates. IUU fishing can also undermine port and maritime security, as criminal elements may use similar trade routes, landing sites, and vessels as used for trafficking arms, migrants, drugs, and other contraband.

Over one-third of fish and fish products enter into international trade, generating billions in trade revenue. But IUU fishers avoid the operational costs associated with sustainable fisheries management to access the lucrative global fisheries market. IUU fishing puts legitimate producers at a disadvantage in this global market, and results in global losses in the tens of billions of dollars each year. Keys to tackling IUU fishing include eliminating the economic incentives that drive it, ensuring that governments effectively monitor and control their fishing vessels, and building capacity in developing countries for fisheries management, enforcement, and good governance.

As the largest single-country market for fish and fish products, the third largest wild seafood producer, and the fifth largest exporter of fish and fish products, the United States has a particularly strong stake in combating IUU fishing. The Department of State coordinates closely with other federal agencies, including National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s National Marine Fisheries Service (NOAA Fisheries) and the U.S. Coast Guard, to implement domestic and international actions related to combatting IUU fishing, including:

Supporting bilateral and cooperative fisheries law enforcement agreements between the U.S. Coast Guard and partner countries known as “ shiprider ” agreements, which support nations with limited resources through personnel training and by placing their enforcement personnel on U.S. vessels, where they may exercise their law enforcement authorities during enforcement operations.

The Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Reauthorization Act of 2006

The Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Reauthorization Act of 2006 (MSRA) amended the main U.S. domestic fisheries legislation to add the first-ever comprehensive mandates to improve international fishery conservation and management, with an emphasis on strengthening controls on IUU fishing. The MSRA requires the Secretary of Commerce to provide a biennial report to Congress on international fisheries, which includes identifying States whose vessels have engaged in IUU fishing. The Department of State works closely with the NOAA Fisheries in the lead-up and preparation of this report.

Once a nation is identified, the Department of State works with NOAA Fisheries to initiate a two-year consultation process to encourage that nation to take necessary measures to address the issue for which it was identified. Following these consultations, NOAA Fisheries determines whether to negatively or positively certify the identified nation in the next Report to Congress. A positive certification is issued if the nation has provided evidence of actions that address the activities for which it was identified. A negative certification may result in denial of U.S. port access for fishing vessels of that nation, and potential import restrictions on fish or fish products.

Seafood Import Monitoring Program

The Seafood Import Monitoring Program (SIMP) is a key component of a U.S. seafood traceability system designed to prevent the products of IUU fishing or misrepresented seafood from entering the $20.5 billion U.S. market. SIMP created mandatory permitting, data reporting, and record-keeping requirements for U.S. importers of 13 seafood species and species groups identified as being particularly vulnerable to IUU fishing or seafood fraud. These are: Atlantic cod, Atlantic blue crab, abalone, dolphinfish (Mahi Mahi), grouper, red king crab, Pacific cod, red snapper, sea cucumber, sharks, shrimp, swordfish, and albacore, bigeye, skipjack, yellowfin, and bluefin tuna. The information collected through SIMP includes details about what the product is, where and how it was produced, and how it moved through the value chain before reaching the United States. Other programs collect comparable information for U.S.-produced seafood products of the same species. Traceability measures like SIMP help to facilitate legal trade for law-abiding fishers and seafood producers in the United States. OES works closely with NOAA Fisheries to coordinate with U.S. trading partners and support the effective implementation of SIMP.
Indonesia destroyed 23 foreign fishing boats on Tuesday, as worsening relations over the disputed South China Sea drive countries to take tougher action to defend their maritime sovereignty.

Maritime and Fisheries Minister Susi Pudjiastuti said her agency sank 10 Malaysian and 13 Vietnamese boats that were caught fishing illegally in Indonesian waters.

Jakarta. Indonesian authorities have intercepted two Filipino and Vietnamese vessels for allegedly looting fish in the waters of Raja Ampat, Papua province, a military official said.

The vessels, carrying 10 and 13 crewmen, were detained on Tuesday morning (31/05) by an Indonesian military vessel after being pursued for around 13 hours.

The vessels, measuring 12 and 14 gross tons respectively, were intercepted after refusing to heed orders to stop and three warning shots, said Lt. Col. Maman Sulaeman, a spokesman for the Indonesian Navy.

"They had no willingness to stop and tried to evade. But they eventually gave up," Maman said on Tuesday, as quoted by state-run Antara, adding that they were then taken to the Sorong naval base in West Papua.

The spokesman said military personnel seized eight tons of sea cucumbers which were allegedly taken from Raja Ampat waters from the Filipino vessel.

Neither vessel had permits to operate and crew members failed to produce identity cards, Maman added.

The Indonesian government is currently ramping up patrols of Indonesian waters in line with strict policies against illegal fishing in vulnerable border regions.

A similar incident occurred off Natuna Islands, where Indonesia last week detained a Chinese fishing boat.

Indonesia has been signaling for the past few years that it will be more vigorously defending its maritime resources. It loses billions of dollars every year to illegal fishing. This weekend tensions flared over an operation conducted on Friday (June 17) against Chinese fishing vessels operating within the exclusive economic zone (EEZ) of Indonesia’s Natuna islands.

According to China, several Indonesian navy ships opened fire on Chinese fishing vessels, injuring a Chinese fisherman in what it called a “traditional Chinese fishing ground.”

“China strongly protests and condemns such excessive use of force,” said foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying in Beijing yesterday (June 19). “China urges Indonesia to stop taking action that escalates tension, complicates issues or affects peace and stability.”

Indonesia’s navy confirmed the incident, but it said nobody was harmed, and that a Chinese-flagged vessel was detained.

historicair/Wikipedia, CC-BY-3.0 UNCLOS territorial jurisdictions.

Indonesia doesn’t view its EEZ as a “Chinese fishing ground,” of course. Instead it considers fishing operations there by other nations to be theft.

Susi Pudjiastuti, head of Indonesia’s maritime affairs and fisheries ministry, confirmed as much in a tweet (link in Indonesian) this morning, saying that stealing fish is “criminal” and there can be no agreement among nations that will allow the theft of fish.

An EEZ extends 200 nautical miles from a nation’s shore, and within it a country has exclusive rights to natural resources, including fish, according to the 1982 United Nations’ Convention on the Law of the Sea.

But in recent years China has been aggressively asserting a claim to most of the South China Sea, based on a “nine-dash line” it drew on a map in the 1940s. In the case of Indonesia, the line overlaps with the EEZ that extends from the Natuna islands. In recent months China has had several other encounters with Chinese fishing vessels operating with its EEZ.

In March an Indonesian patrol vessel tried to apprehend such a trawler operating in the EEZ, but China’s coast guard aggressively interfered. This sort of behavior has prompted Indonesia to beef up its military presence on the Natunas and even enlist the services of nano-satellites to better locate trespassing ships. In May, Indonesia again tried to capture a trespassing Chinese trawler. This time it succeeded—but only because it brought along a warship.

Hasjim Djalal, an Indonesian expert on maritime affairs and former ambassador the UN, said that China’s nine-dash line is unfounded. With Chinese fishing vessels operating in Indonesian territory, “we need to prepare the navy to protect our sovereignty,” he said on June 13, just five days before the incident on Friday.
There are 152 ship crew members in total, and all of them are Filipinos."

Ternate (ANTARA News) - The Indonesian Navy detained four Philippine vessels on suspicion of conducting illegal fishing in the waters of North Maluku.The four foreign vessels, intercepted in the waters of Morotai Island on June 11, are now secured at the Perikanan Nusantara port in Ternate, North Maluku, Commander of Karel Satsuitubun 356 Navy Ship Lieutenant Colonel Dados Raino stated here on Wednesday.The four foreign vessels are F/B Brasshell Dum 3030, F/B Brasshell Dum, F/B Yanrei, and Pambod Nino Aqua IV."There are 152 ship crew members in total, and all of them are Filipinos," Raino noted.The Pambod Nino Aqua IV was sailing solo and was intercepted at a location 12 miles from the border, while the other three vessels were cruising together in a group.The captains of the vessels failed to present legal documents or permits to conduct fishing in the Indonesian maritime territory, while the authority found some 300 kilograms of tuna on board.Indonesia has been taking important steps in line with the trend of sustainable fisheries management policies, including the efforts to fight illegal, unregulated and unreported (IUU) fishing practices.Despite the Indonesian governments policy of detonating and sinking illegal foreign fishing vessels, the authority continues to encounter vessels trespassing and poaching in its waters.The Indonesian government has, since October 2014, sunk at least 151 foreign ships caught conducting illegal fishing practices in the countrys waters, Minister of Marine Affairs and Fisheries Susi Pudjiastuti revealed.The vessels involved in IUU fishing that were sunk comprised 50 ships from Vietnam, 43 from the Philippines, 21 from Thailand, 20 from Malaysia, two from Papua New Guinea, and one from China.The government has also sunk 14 Indonesian-flagged ships involved in IUU fishing.
Squid fishing vessel 'Hau Li 8'. (Photo: Daniel Antunez) Is Argentina on the verge of a new conflict with Uruguay? ARGENTINA

Monday, March 07, 2016, 21:40 (GMT + 9) An illegal fishing boat escaped after being chased by members of the Argentine Naval Prefecture (PNA), and took refuge later in Uruguayan waters. The Chinese fishing vessel Hua Li 8 was surprised on Monday February 29 by the Argentine Navy when it was illegally fishing within 200 miles of the EEZ. The ship managed to escape to international waters and days later was detected when it was about to enter the port of Montevideo, after crossing again the Argentine Sea. Two Coast Guard boats and a helicopter of the Argentine Naval Force were sent in pursuit of the pirate squid fishing boat. According to what informed FIS.com Marine Conservation expert Milko Schvartzman, just before entering the port of Montevideo, the boat changed course and headed out of the area of binational jurisdiction of the river Rio de la Plata, to Punta del Este. When the fishing boat was practically within the 12 miles of the territorial sea of Uruguay, Argentine ships stopped the pursuit, as it can be seen through the satellite images provided by Schvartzman. Last part of the chase of the 'Hau Li 8' (L) and the coast guard vessel 'Mantilla' following the Chinese squid fishing boat. In a note sent to FIS.com, the expert informed that according to the newspaper reports published in Uruguay, the events took a different hue, and were more dramatic (*1): 'An aircraft of the naval aviation of our country warned the two Argentine ships and the helicopter of Prefecture that they could not go through that limit, which was immediately understood by the commanders of the three ships, who changed their attitude' ... 'The injured crew member was a person who was hit by shrapnel from bullets that were fired from the ships of Armada Argentina in order to persuade the crew of the fishing vessel.' 'The ship was almost in front of Montevideo when the incident was reported.' Crew members under slave conditions in Montevideo Argentine news did not inform on the injured crew member due to an attempt to express persuasion through guns or that Uruguay has banned Argentine vessels to continue the pursuit. "Although it sounds surprising, dozens of pirate, illegal ships, or as it is internationally called ‘IUU’ (illegal, unregulated and unreported) are supplied and logistically supported in the port of Montevideo," emphasizes Schvartzman. "The Hua Li 8 is part of a fleet having five ships 'Hua Li' operating in the South Atlantic, among hundreds of pirate ships of Chinese, Korean, Taiwanese, Spanish or British (Falklands) nationality, which all these flags have in common is that many of their vessels, use Montevideo as a logistics base, as a source of supplies and to launder illegal catches." "What is exceptional in this case is that the persecution occurs in Uruguayan water, a clear message from the Government of Argentina to Tabare Vazquez," points out the Marine Conservation expert. He adds: "Many of these boats, not only enter illegally to fish within the EEZ of the States, but their crew is enslaved and survive under extreme unsanitary conditions, poor nutrition, and violence on board." "For over a decade, all kinds of complaints are regularly recorded as well as killings of crew members of fishing boats frequently visiting Uruguay (*2). It also occurs near the Falklands, where every year, victims of human trafficking jump into the frozen southern waters in an attempt to escape the abuse on board, often losing their lives in the attempt." "There are plenty of records of vessels that have illegally fished in the Argentine Sea, and days later they restock in Montevideo to plunder the South Atlantic again." The 'Hau Li 8' fishing in the South Atlantic, on February 16 2016, and in Punta Arenas (Chile), on December 14, 2015. Schvartzman also notes that today, the Insung 3, a Korean fishing vessel, which in 2014 was fined by his own government for illegal fishing within the EEZ of Argentina with the Insung 7, which was dismantled as punishment for the same offense, is being refueled together with boats from Buquebus. "Many of these vessels have not only violated international law but they have been convicted in other latitudes, as is the case of the Oyang 75 and Oyang 77, which were seized by the Government of New Zealand for overfishing, slavery and abusing crew members on board. In the case of the Insung, Playa de Pesmar Dos, from Spain, which has license from the Falklands and was denounced of committing labour abuse in 2010, as the Tong Young No. 808, which was caught in the waters of the Argentine EEZ in 2014," recalls Schvartzman. He also stresses that the list of vessels engaged in furtive fishing or with licenses from the Falklands that are supplied in the port of Montevideo is very long. "The vessels fishing in the Southwest Atlantic, are not regulated in any way, from an environmental, or labour, or health and safety to sail. Their capture is predatory, their waste and pollutants are thrown overboard, as well as their crew in case of a conflict on board. They are pirate ships, literally, which launder their illegal catch in the port of Montevideo, from which it is then exported to markets in Europe or the United States, at half the price of regulated catches," he says. Satellite photo of the squid fishing fleet. According to Schvartzman, "during the peak of the fishing season, a floating city of about 400 boats, predate the Region, not only affecting the marine ecosystem through the capture of key species in the oceanic food chain, but they also affect the jobs of regional fisheries, regulated in the environmental, labour and safety aspects, despite their shortcomings ". In his view, "beyond what is condemnable, the fact that Uruguay will benefit from millions of dollars from human trafficking, slavery and pillaging of the South Atlantic also seriously affect fishing economies and employment throughout the region, even in Uruguay, where local fishermen can not compete against Asian vessels whose fuel is subsidized, and do not meet any environmental, safety regulations or labour regulations.” "This situation is much more serious than the resonant conflict over the installation of the pulp mill on the river shared by both countries. If a resolution is not taken by both governments, a more serious incident will end up bursting," he predicts. Finally, he adds that as the article in La Nación, 'Uruguayans failed to offer positive assistance' (* 3).

Korean law enforcement authority abused by illegal Chinese fishing boats. October. 10, 2016 07:13. by 한기흥기자 eligius@donga.com.

Chinese fishing boats intentionally rammed into and sank a small speedboat of the Korean Coast Guard, which was cracking down on more than 40 Chinese boats engaged in illegal fishing in waters some 76 kilometers southwest of Socheong Island in Incheon on Friday afternoon. When eight coast guard officers got onboard a 100-ton Chinese fishing boat and tried to open a locked iron door using a cutter, another Chinese fishing boat rammed into a side of the Korean patrol boat, whose captain jumped off just before the boat sank. The Coast Guard fired dozens of shots with rifles and pistols defensively but the fishing boats ran away.

South Korea's Coast Guard Headquarters summoned a consul general at the Chinese Embassy in Seoul on Sunday and made a formal complaint for Chinese fishing boasts' illegal fishing and attempted murder. Chinese fishing boats, which are armed as heavily as pirate boats, are often violently resisting crackdown by the Korean authority even by using axes, knives and bamboo spears, while engaging in illegal fishing after violating into Korea’s exclusive economic zone. In December 2011, coast guard sergeant Lee Cheong-ho was stabbed to death by a Chinese fisherman, who resisted crackdown. The South Korean government repeatedly requested China to clamp down on illegal fishing, but nothing has changed. If China values Seoul-Beijing ties, it should identify boats that ran away and sternly punish the fishermen responsible.

Many critics say that since the Korea Coast Guard was annexed it into the Public Safety and Security Ministry following the 2014 sinking of the Sewol ferry, Korea’s response to China’s illegal fishing has weakened. Again this time, only two 4.5-ton patrol boats attempted to crack down on Chinese fishing boats that responded collectively and systematically, which is overly ambitious to some extent. As the Korea Coast Guard, which lacks manpower and equipment, has only tried to shoo away Chinese fishing boats, rather than arresting them, Chinese fishing boats are freely moving around in Korean waters as if in their own waters.

Some news reports suggested the Public Safety and Security Ministry allegedly blocked the Coast Guard from disclosing the Friday incident to the media. If Korea let Chinese fishing boats continue illegal fishing while being wary of Beijing, China will have little reason to block their fishing boats from engaging in illegal acts. It is the grave reality that South Korean fishermen are being curbed from engaging in fishing near the Northern Limit Line in the Yellow Sea due to concern over possible clash with North Korea, and have no choice but to let Chinese fishing boats engaged in illegal fishing of all fish, big and small. The Korean public feel anger to see the Korea Coast Guard being abused and ridiculed by Chinese fishing boats while failing to properly exercise its sovereign rights within our own waters.

KUALA LUMPUR — The Malaysian Maritime Enforcement Agency (MMEA) has detained 23 Vietnamese fishermen on charges of illegally fishing in the waters off of Terengganu and Pahang states.



They were detained during two round-ups called Operation Perkasa Timur and Operation Marikh, about two hours after they were first spotted by the agency’s patrol craft on Friday, the New Straits Time quoted MMEA Eastern regional Director Khoo Teng Chuan as saying.



The MMEA seized two fishing vessels along with 450kg of fish and squid.



Khoo said the two vessels were seized on their way back to Việt Nam with their catches.



None of the Vietnamese nationals had travel documents. They were brought to shore for further investigation.



The Vietnamese Embassy in Malaysia has sent a diplomatic note and contacted relevant authorities to learn more about the case.

Fishing boats seized in Thai waters

Thailand’s Naval Zone 2 force seized three Vietnamese fishing ships with 33 fishermen onboard for illegally entering and fishing on its territorial waters, the local Thai Rath newspaper reported.



The ships were seized offshore Nakhon Si Thammarat Province in southern Thailand on Friday night. They are now being detained in Songkhla Province.



A source in Songkhla said three boat captains went on trial on Saturday morning. Crewmembers will have to give testimony over allegations that they were forced onto these ships.



Also stopped was a Thai vessel with 14 people aboard that carried 30,000 litres of oil to feed the Vietnamese ships.



Since the beginning of 2016, the Naval Zone 2 force has stopped 17 Vietnamese ships involved in illegal fishing.

Earlier this week, the Thai navy said they detained another five Vietnamese vessels for illegally fishing in Thailand’s exclusive economic zone.



Speaking at a press conference at the Sattahip military port in the southern Chonburi Province on Thursday, Rear Admiral Watson Booneung said the ships carrying 37 fishermen were seized off Thailand’s Trat coastal province, which borders Cambodia.



Crewmembers said they were fishermen from the southern province of Cà Mau who left their hometown on March 27 and had their boats seized on April 5.



The area where they were arrested is near the location where five Vietnamese boats with 47 fishermen onboard were captured on April 3.



Watson Booneung revealed that the Thai navy seized a total of 11 boats with 102 Vietnamese fishermen onboard for illegal fishing in Thai waters April 3-7. —VNS
Cape Town - A man who was caught with abalone worth R300 000 following a police chase will appear in the Strand Magistrate's Court on Friday on charges of illegal possession and transporting of abalone, Western Cape police confirmed.

The 27-year-old man was arrested on Wednesday night by the members of SAPS K9 unit after they spotted a driver speaking on his cellphone while driving down Sir Lowry's Pass toward Somerset West, said spokesperson Captain FC Van Wyk.

When the vehicle stopped in the middle of the road near an intersection, the officers approached and the bakkie sped off, followed by a second bakkie.

While the first bakkie managed to evade police, the officers pulled the second vehicle over on the N2 near Lwandle.

"Upon approaching the [vehicle], the members noticed various plastic bags through an open canopy window. These bags all contained abalone," Van Wyk said.

The man was arrested and the contraband was seized.

"Officials from the Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries were summoned to Lwandle police station where the abalone was counted. It amounted to 2 447 units of shucked abalone. It must still be weighed to determine the exact value, but was estimated at approximately R300 000."
NOAA Fisheries report identifies IUU in Ecuador, Mexico, South Korea

NOAA Fisheries has released its 2019 report to the U.S. Congress, identifying the organization’s efforts to combat illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing internationally while also rebuking three countries for lack of sufficient enforcement against IUU.

The biennial report on improving international fisheries management – made to Congress as part of the High Seas Driftnet Fishing Moratorium Protection Act – identified Ecuador, Mexico, and the Republic of Korea has three countries that failed to sufficiently comply with agreed-upon regulations related to IUU. The report also credited Ecuador, Mexico, and the Russian Federation for earlier work to react to IUU allegations made in NOAA’s 2017 report to congress.

Ecuador had earlier been identified by NOAA for having 25 vessels with violations of the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission (IATTC) resolutions, which were made in 2014, 2015, and 2016. Several of the vessels, the report states, were “repeat offenders.” At the time, Ecuador was notified through the U.S. Department of State about the IUU activity.

Following that notification, Ecuador provided documents and took corrective actions that were sufficient enough for NOAA to make a positive certification determination for the country.

However, the country has continued to have vessels that violate IATTC resolutions, and according to the NOAA the country hasn’t taken sufficient steps to investigate potential offenses, including violations of protections for sea turtles and tuna discards.

“Specifically, it appears that Ecuador’s actions were limited to review of observer documents related to the allegation. If the observer forms in question were left blank, Ecuador apparently concluded there was no violation,” the NOAA report states.

Mexico, as well, was given both praise for reaction to past instances of IUU and was identified as continuing to allow IUU. In the 2017 report, the country as identified for having vessels fishing without authorization in U.S. waters, typically red snapper fished illegally in the United States’ Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) in the Gulf of Mexico.

Since the identification, according to the NOAA report, the country has provided details of their enforcement against the offending vessels, as well as providing evidence of the charges brought against the vessels that participated in IUU. Those efforts led to a positive certification determination for Mexico.

However, the same problems are still continuing, according to NOAA. Vessels are still fishing illegally in U.S. waters in the Gulf of Mexico for red snapper in similar numbers.

“These vessels are known to have deleterious effects on finfish stocks, including red snapper, as well as bycatch of protected sea turtles,” the NMFS report states. “NOAA, the National Parks Service, and the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department have reported significant strandings of turtles on beaches in Texas, likely the result of bycatch by Mexican vessels illegally fishing in U.S. waters.”

Mexico is taking efforts to stop the IUU, with increasing numbers of prosecutions and fines imposed on Mexican nationals found guilty of fishing in U.S. waters. However, the fines have not seemed to stem the tide of IUU boats, according to the NOAA report.

“Based on consultations with Mexico on this issue, it appears that while control of, and compliance by, the licensed fleet may have improved, there continues to be an unlicensed fleet that operates without meaningful monitoring or control by Mexico,” the NMFS report states.

The IUU fishing is of particular concern to the U.S. due to the volume of fresh and frozen snapper – the main species being caught illegally – that the country imports each year from Mexico. In 2018, the U.S. imported 4,796,693 kilograms of red snapper from the country, with a declared value of slightly more than USD 33 million (EUR 30 million). The concern is some of that amount could have included fish illegally caught in U.S. waters.

An additional issue is the amount of money the U.S. spends fighting Mexican IUU.

“The United States, particularly the [United States Coast Guard], consistently expends considerable resources and assumes significant operational risk to locate, deter and interdict these vessels,” the NMFS report states.

The NMFS is looking for some sort of measurable change to the amount of incursions by Mexican vessels.

The one country that wasn’t both certified and then rebuked was the Russian Federation. In the 2017 report, the Russian Federation was identified due to vessels violating rules in the Commission for Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR).

After being notified by the U.S. Department of State, the Russian Federation met with intergovernmental committees and resolved the issues by opening investigations into all IUU cases, and disclosing all information found to stakeholders. Through the process, Russia punished those found violating the CCAMLR, and further provided recommendations to prevent further issues.

Those steps were sufficient enough that NOAA made a positive certification determination for the Russian Federation, and the country was not mentioned again in the 2019 report.

One country was added to the offending list in 2019: The Republic of Korea. The U.S. has filed a complaint for the first time against South Korea in response to the country’s lack of action against IUU activities.

Two vessels flagged to South Korea – Hong Jin No. 701 and Southern Ocean – violated CCAMLR conservation measures in 2017, according to NOAA, and the country failed to take effective actions against the violations. The report states that while South Korea has robust criminal penalties, it does not include administrative or civil remedies.

“Therefore, when the prosecutor declines prosecution due to insufficient evidence that the violation was intentional (Hong Jin No. 701), or suspends the indictment (Southern Ocean), there are no other mechanisms available for addressing violations or depriving the violators of the economic benefit of their illegal activity,” the NMFS states.

Violators who have been suspected of IUU but not prosecuted can go on to benefit from the illegal activity, as Korean law has no methods of seizing property prior to a conviction.

China, as well, was mentioned in the report but did not get a specific identification. NOAA listed out a series of “concerns’” with China’s fishing practices, including the “significant public reports of alleged illegal fishing by Chinese-flagged vessels in the EEZs of other nations.”

The report lists multiple incidents in Argentina’s EEZ, including one vessel that was sunk by the Argentine Coast Guard after it tried to collide and flee from official ships. Argentina’s Coast Guard has opened fire on Chinese-flagged vessels in the past, and the country has issued capture orders on multiple ships that have fled the region.

Chinese-flagged vessels have caused issues in other countries as well. In 2017, Sengalese authorities detained seven Chinese-flagged vessels; eight other vessels were detained in Guinea, Sierra Leone, and Guinea Bissau; Chinese-flagged vessels were found fishing illegally in Vanuatu and Micronesia; and the Ecuadorian Coast Guard detained a vessel in the waters of the Galapagos Islands Marine Reserve and discovered 300 tons of illegally caught fish.

Despite the incidents, NOAA fisheries decided not to list China alongside the others due to the specific definitions in the Moratorium Protection Act that mandates the report.

“After careful analysis, NOAA has determined these particular allegations do not meet the current definition of IUU fishing for the purposes of identification under the MPA and its implementing regulations,” the report states. “NOAA will engage with China to seek information on its efforts to exercise responsible flag state control over its distant water fishing vessels and to confirm that it is taking the necessary steps to ensure compliance by its fleet. We will also continue to take steps to ensure that the United States is not importing seafood derived from this type of IUU fishing activity.”

Navy chases down two illegal Vietnamese trawlers

The Royal Thai Navy yesterday seized two fishing trawlers and arrested 11 Vietnamese crew members off Songkhla province.

The arrests followed a tip-off by a Thai-flagged trawler that the two Vietnamese boats were operating in the exclusive economic zone, 14 nautical miles northeast of the Bongkot natural gas site in the Gulf of Thailand.

HTMS Thai Muang of the 2nd Naval Area Command, which was on regular patrol, was deployed to track down the boats. The Vietnamese crews were apprehended with their trawlers after attempting to slip away.

The crews and their vessels were taken to the Songkhla Naval Base.

Under the questioning, the crews said they had sailed from Ben Tre province to fish in Thai waters.

They have been charged with violations of the 1939 Right to Fish in Thai Fishery Waters Act and the 2015 Royal Ordinance on Fisheries. They will be sent to Muang Songkhla police station to face prosecution before being repatriated.

Authorities will also inform the Vietnamese embassy of the arrests.

Vice-Adm Pornchai Pinthong, the 2nd Naval Area Command chief, said it was the 22nd interception of foreign-flagged fishing vessels trespassing in Thai waters this year.

Authorities have arrested 310 crew members and confiscated 48 vessels, he said.
GEORGE TOWN: Nine Indonesian nationals were detained for fishing illegally in the Malaysian waters about 4.50pm on May 22.

Malaysian Maritime Enforcement Agency (MMEA) district two enforcement chief First Admiral Kamaruszaman Abu Hassan said all of them were detained for illegal fishing after their two boats were spotted at 42 nautical miles southwest of Pulau Kendi.

Two of the detained fishermen, he added, were repeat offenders.

He said the seized boats were brought to the Batu Maung Jetty as evidence.

A total of 200kg of fish were also confiscated during the operation.

The case is being investigated under Section 15 (1) of Fishing Act 1985 for fishing without permission from Director General of Malaysian Fisheries Department.

He urged members of the public with information on illegal fishing activities to contact MMEA at 04-2626146.
Walter Nyamukondiwa: Chinhoyi Bureau

At least four Zambians illegally camped in Zimbabwean territory have been arrested in Kariba and a tonne of fish recovered. The arrest follows joint operations and patrols by the Zimbabwe Parks and Wildlife Management Authority and the Bumi Hills Anti-Poaching Unit recently.The identity particulars of the four; two men and two women believed to be their wives, could not be established immediately. Patrols around the Kota Kota area established that there were illegal fishing camps suspected to belong to Zambian nationals. They were inspected and found to be vacant leading to further foot patrols, which found a camp tucked across Namagwaba island.

The Bumi Hills Anti-Poaching Unit reports that skirmishes broke out but the team of rangers managed to subdue them.

“A routine patrol around the Kota Kota narrows area yielded evidence of a number of illegal fishing camps established by Zambians on the Zimbabwean mainland and islands,” reads the BHAPU website.

“A number of well-known camps were checked and found to be uninhabited but a foot patrol across Namagwaba island uncovered a new camp.”

Investigations established that the four had been camped on the island for the past three weeks. The couples were using prohibited twine nets with a combined length of about 1,2km to fish during the night.

They would catch fish indiscriminately regardless of size and specie and they were smoking and drying them when they were arrested. The fish recovered weighed about 300kg which is estimated to be around one tonne live weight.

Parks and Wildlife Management Authority spokesperson Ms Caroline Washaya-Moyo, confirmed the arrest of a number of illegal fishermen in Kariba. At least 200 fishermen have been arrested so far with 30 of them being Zambians.

“Zimbabwe Parks and Wildlife Management Authority can confirm that a number of fish poachers were arrested in the period January to date,” she said.

“Most illegal fishing activities happen during night, but the authority’s rangers always patrol the length and breadth of the lake, hence the arrests. During the day, the teams also maintain their presence as part of law enforcement.”

The arrests spanning from January to date have managed to recover 2 658kg of fish and 300kg of kapenta. At least 78 illegal boats have been confiscated and 22 fishing rigs impounded. In the latest incident, the illegal camp was destroyed while the fishermen and their wives were handed over to the police.

Their boat and the illegal nets were impounded.

Meanwhile, a Zimbabwean kapenta rig was impounded for fishing in an illegal area without a permit. Kapenta fishing is done at designated areas with a depth of more than 20m to circumvent shallow breeding areas. Such an offence attracts a fine of $20 and a further $2000 to secure the release of the rig.
Cape Town - The police’s organised crime unit is investigating an abalone haul, now confirmed to be worth R5m, which was found on an Intercape bus when an anonymous tip-off led to a raid at the Cape Town station bus terminal on Wednesday.

Fifty boxes of abalone, weighing about 1 000kg, were discovered on the bus bound for Pretoria when the City of Cape Town's Marine Unit acted on the information.

Police spokesperson Captain FC Van Wyk said no suspects had been found on the scene and no arrests had yet been made.

The contraband was handed over to the Sea Border Policing Unit, he confirmed.

Mayoral committee member for safety and security, JP Smith, to whom the tip-off was directed, alleged it was known that "poached marine goods are exchanged for drugs and one must wonder how much drugs and guns have been transported into Cape Town smuggled in the bottom of these buses".

He called for the police and the Hawks to investigate Intercape and its owners.

But the company in a statement said it was "apparent that Mr Smith may have reacted in haste before the facts were determined".

Intercape said it was because of its swift action that the bust was carried out.

The company said it had various crime prevention measures in place, including personnel training, an internal investigation unit comprising former police members, sniffer dogs and a tip-off line for members of the public to report crime.

"We will continue in our efforts to prevent our services and vehicles from being used for any criminal purposes. We will also call on the support in such efforts from the City of Cape Town with a view on improving infrastructural security measures at Cape Town station, which could further assist in the fight against crime," the statement reads.

The company said it would further assist and cooperate with the authorities in their further investigations and condemned the use of its vehicles for criminal purposes.

Smith, however, maintained that the haul was too big for it not to have been noticed.

"If anyone in that company should be found to have been involved, there should be repercussions," he said.
Over $1 million in illegal drugs were seized this morning on a fishing vessel in Tobago.

According to reports, officers at the Coast Guard were conducting routine patrols in the Caribbean Sea when around 5:45am today, they had cause to intercept a fishing vessel with two occupants.

The vessel had left Toco earlier that morning and was destined for Tobago.

The vessel was searched and the officers allegedly found and seized 14 packets of cocaine and 11 packets of marijuana.

The drugs, sources said, both came up to at least 20 kilogrammes.

As a result of the find, the two men were arrested and taken into custody.

They have since been handed over to the Organised Crime, Firearms and Narcotics Unit in Tobago.

More on this as it becomes available.
The anti-smuggling unit of the Pakistan Customs has seized a huge quantity of contraband goods and Irani diesel worth millions of rupees.

Irfan Ali, a spokesman for the Pakistan Customs, said the anti-smuggling unit of the Model Custom Collectorate of Preventive Customs seized 26,500 litres of smuggled and non-duty paid Iranian diesel along with a wooden boat, named Al-Nasiri, during an operation in the sea near the Karachi coast.

The operation was launched pursuant to secret information that a wooden fishing boat having fitted with specially designed tanks would be used for transportation of smuggled and non-duty paid Iranian diesel from the Coast of Pushikan to the Coast of Karachi, he said. An FIR was lodged and seven crew members of the wooden boat have been arrested.

He said a fresh drive had been launched to curb the menace of smuggling of Iranian petroleum products and other foreign origin contraband and merchandise goods mainly arriving from Balochistan through the RCD Highway and other coastal routes.

As a result of the fresh offensive, he said, the anti-smuggling organisation has made sizable seizures of huge quantities of smuggled and non-duty paid Iranian diesel, contraband goods, electronic items, cloth, cigarettes, household items, crockery, perfumes, cosmetics, smuggled and non-duty paid vehicles, and other merchandise goods worth millions of rupees during the last six months.

At least 59 Indian fishermen were arrested in Pakistan for poaching in the country’s waters, the media reported on Sunday.

“The Indian fishermen were arrested by the Maritime Security Agency (MSA) on Thursday while they were fishing in the Pakistani limits of the Arabian Sea,” said a senior official.

Most of the arrested fishermen, he said, belonged to Gujarat.

This arrest of fishermen came days after the two countries released imprisoned fishermen.

On March 6, Pakistan released some 87 Indian fishermen and then only after two weeks, on March 20, it freed 86 more, who left for Lahore by train in the afternoon where they were handed over to Indian authorities at the Wagah border.

On March 17, nine Pakistani fishermen were freed by India after they had spent some 17 months in the Jamnagar jail in Gujarat.
KOROR – After two weeks of surveillance, Palau's patrol boat, Remeliik intercepted and seized two Vietnamese fishing boats.

The vessels were spotted by a Pacific Mission Aviation plane that was working with Palau on surveillance. The vessels were brought to port last week with their crew.

“Palau is doing very well in training on how to enforce the Marine Sanctuary Law. We have a strong law, good marine coordination and excellent support and coordination with the AGO and the court system. While this is a gradual process that will require time to improve, there is excellent visible progress,” Attorney General Bradley said.

Since February, two separate seizures of fishing vessels from the Philippines have been made. Captains of the vessels have been charged with illegal fishing under the Marine Sanctuary Law.

Last week, Palau Supreme Court sentenced the two captains of the vessels to 60 days in jail and forfeiture of their vessels and equipment.

To send the message about Palau’s seriousness in implement its marine laws, two Vietnamese fishing boats were burned in a publicly recorded event that was broadcast worldwide.

Yemen: Houthi shelling hits farms in coastal Hodeidah

14 December

Houthi rebels launched a shelling attack which hit a farm in the Tuhyata district of Hodeidah. The shelling caused extensive damage to the farm, though no civilian casualties have yet been reported. In October, the UN deployed cease-fire observers in Hodeidah and established five observation points near the military contact lines between the warring sides.

Analysis: Whilst this incident shows no increase in the risk to shipping in the area, it shows the delicate nature of the conflict in coastal regions where hostilities have, in the past, spilled into the littoral.

Greece: Pirates released 3 crew members of seized tanker

14 December

Pirates released three crew members of a Greek-flagged tanker who were kidnapped off the coast of Togo on 4 November, the tanker’s manager announced. The fourth abducted crew member, a Philippine national, died during captivity.

Maldives: Significant floods reported in Male

12 December

Significant floods have been reported in Male, notably in the southwest of the city, following heavy rainfall across the country. According to the Maldives Meteorological Services, more rain is forecast across the country through at least 15 December, prompting authorities to advise against all but necessary sea travel between islands. Transportation and business disruptions are likely over the coming days.

Libya: Head of eastern-based parliament says maritime deal with Turkey is invalid

12 December

The head of Libya’s eastern-based parliament aligned with warlord General Khalifa Haftar said the accord between Libya and Turkey establishing maritime boundaries is invalid. Greece expelled the Libyan ambassador over the accord establishing a sea corridor between Libya and Turkey and in areas where Greece considers it has maritime rights.

Analysis: The development is likely to add to insecurity in the coastal area off Libya, especially for Turkish flagged vessels.

Southeast Asia

Phillipines: Customs seize 48 containers of sugar at Manila port

17 December

Customs seized at least 48 containers of refined sugar from China at Manila port, local media reported. The sugar was falsely declared as steel, screws, clamps, nails and hardware fittings. The containers arrived between August and September but were only examined in November. Smuggling attempts in the Philippines often falsely declare items to avoid higher duties when the goods are imported into the country.

Analysis: Security successes on the part of the Philippines’ authority signal positive signs for maritime and port security in the region.

Indonesia: Magnitude 5.6 earthquake strikes off the coast of Sumatra

16 December

The US Geological Survey recorded a 5.6-magnitude earthquake around 116 km south-southwest of Sungai Penuh, Sumatra Island. The quake hit at around 2149 hrs local time at a depth of 30 km. No tsunami warning was immediately issued. Aftershocks are possible in the affected area over the coming hours and days.

Vanuatu: Magnitude 5.9 earthquake strikes off coast of Gaua

14 December

The US Geological Survey recorded a 5.9-magnitude earthquake south-southeast of Gaua, Banks Islands. The quake hit at approximately 1557 hrs local time at a depth of 27 km. Officials did not issue a tsunami warning and there were no reports of casualties or infrastructural damage in the area. Vanuatu lies on the Pacific ‘Ring of Fire’ and regularly experiences natural disasters, including cyclones, volcanic activity, earthquakes and tsunamis, with over 2,000 seismic events reported each year.

Malaysia: Maritime forces seize Vietnamese oil tanker found off coast

12 December

Malaysian maritime forces seized Vietnamese oil tanker Viet Tin 01 after it was found adrift off the Malaysian coast. The tanker reportedly visited North Korea in February according to Reuters. The Malaysian Maritime Enforcement Agency said a team of officers boarded the tanker after it was found anchored without authorization just off the southern Malaysian state of Johor.

Analysis: Seas around Malaysia continue to experience heightened tension.

West Africa

Togo: India says 20 crew kidnapped from tanker off Togo

15 December

India’s foreign ministry has said that 20 of its nationals had been kidnapped from an oil tanker in West African waters, where piracy has been on the rise. The Marshall Islands-flagged vessel, Duke, was attacked by pirates about 115 nautical miles (about 213km) southeast of the coast of Lome, the capital of Togo. The ship’s operator wrote that the craft was “attacked and boarded” while carrying fuel oil to Lome from Angola and that the company was working with relevant authorities to resolve the incident.

Analysis: The shipping industry has warned in recent months about increased incidents of piracy and kidnapping in the Gulf of Guinea, particularly around Nigeria.

Togo: Abducted crew member dies as 3 more are released

13 December

The Elka Aristotle tanker was attacked off Togo in early November with four of its crew members abducted. Three crew members have been released But one Filipino seafarer died while being held hostage. The four seafarers were on the Greek-flagged tanker, which was attacked by pirates off Togo in early November. The pirates abducted them and left the vessel. Last week, the nine seafarers abducted from a supramax carrier off Benin in early November were released.

Analysis: While West Africa and the Gulf of Guinea in particular has been a perilous region for seafarers for years, the past month has been especially violent.

Gulf Region:International maritime protection plans

US Naval deployments include the Carrier Strike Group 72 in (USS Abraham Lincoln) with the US 5th Fleet in The Gulf in support of the US-led International Maritime Security Construct (IMSC – Op SENTINEL) to protect shipping in the region. There is a similar European initiative planned for early 2020 which will coordinate with IMSC: mounted out of France’s naval base in Abu Dhabi the mission is planned to involve approximately 10 nations including the UK (who are involved in the IMSC now). Believing there is a heightened risk of security incidents in the Straits of Hormuz, the UK Dept for Transport said the aim of the missions is to ensure “UK-flagged ships will soon be able to transit the Strait of Hormuz without close Royal Naval accompaniment…”

Gulf of Guinea: VLCC hijack highlights growing Gulf of Guinea security concerns

Attack signals that security and hardening measures are needed for all types of ships up to 100 nautical miles out from ports in the West African region, says International Maritime Bureau. The comment came after the VLCC attack on 3 December where 19 crew members were abducted and are still being held on shore. The vessel in question was attacked 76 nm offshore whilst transiting without a security escort. The Gulf of Guinea is now rated (by the International Maritime Bureau) as the most dangerous region for piracy accounting for 86% of crew kidnappings and hostage-taking globally. Pirate gangs often operate from mother ships over 100 nm from shore. It was the 4th vessel to have crew kidnapped in 2019.

Peru: Authorities seize 2 tonnes of cocaine from submarine in the Pacific

12 December

Authorities seized 2 tonnes of cocaine from a submarine in the Pacific Ocean some 300 km of the coast. It is unclear how authorities found the vessel. The seizure took place on 8 December though authorities only released information regarding the incident on 12 December. Authorities arrested one Ecuadorian and two Mexican individuals at the scene. According to initial reports the submarine departed from southern Ecuador, near the border with Peru and was bound for Mexico. Drug gangs in Peru and Colombia are known for using submarines to transport narcotics to avoid detection.

A day after seizing 200 kg of endangered sea cucumbers, protected under Schedule I of the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972, Marine Police of Coastal Security Group (CSG) seized 20 kg of the endangered marine species from Devipattinam seashore on Wednesday.

Acting on a tip-off, a special team led by P.S. Ramesh Kumar and G. Ayyanar, Inspector and Sub-Inspector of Police, CSG, respectively, seized the fresh sea cucumbers which were caught by fishermen, and detained one M. Abdullah (54), who procured them at the behest of smugglers.

Abdullah was handed over to the Forest Department. Forest Range Officer S. Ganeshalingam arrested him under Sections 9, 39, 50 and 51 of the Wildlife Protection Act. He was produced before a Magistrate Court here, which remanded him in judicial custody.

The accused told the police that he would procure sea cucumbers from fishermen, who inadvertently caught them while fishing, and store them after processing them. He would deliver them to some contacts who would purchase the species in bulk for smugglers. The smugglers operated from Rameswaram, Verkodu and Pamban areas, the police said.

This was the fourth seizure made by the CSG so far this month, after it stepped up the drive against procurement and sale of the protected species. The CSG and the Forest Department in separate and joint operations have seized about 600 kg of the endangered species since August 1.
GEORGE TOWN: Six Indonesian nationals were detained for fishing illegally in the Malaysian waters at about 11am yesterday.

Malaysian Maritime Enforcement Agency (MMEA) district two enforcement chief First Admiral Kamaruszaman Abu Hassan said a team on routine sea patrol spotted the unregistered boat at 44 nautical miles west of Pulau Kendi.

"When detained we found the captain of the boat and its crew conducting fishing activities from the boat", he said in a statement today.

Kamaruszaman said they were detained and brought to the Batu Maung jetty to be handed over to the Maritime Department for further investigation.

A total of 300 kg of fish were also confiscated during the operation.

The case is being investigated under Fishing Act 1985 for fishing without permission from Director General of Malaysian Fisheries Department.

He said MMEA often received complaints from local fisherman about foreign fishermen enroaching and will increase its operation to curb such activities.

He urged members of the public with information on illegal fishing activities to contact MMEA at 04-2626146.
Spanish Long-liner Detained Over Shark Fishing

On August 6, the Spanish long-line fishing vessel Alemar Primero was boarded in waters belonging to the Central African island state of São Tomé, and authorities found the vessel’s holds filled with dead sharks.

The Príncipe by São Toméan authorities, assisted by Sea Shepherd crew and law enforcement officers from Gabon, confirmed that most of the sharks were blue sharks, classified as “near-threatened” by the IUCN.

The long liner was licensed to fish for “tuna and similar species.”

Many of the shark’s fins had already been detached from their bodies, a suspected violation, says Sea Shepherd, of the European Union Finning Ban (1185/2003) and its amendment (605/2013), which requires sharks to be landed with their Fins Naturally Attached (FNA).

São Toméan authorities ordered the long-liner to retrieve their fishing gear, release their catch and proceed to São Tomé for investigation. With four marines remaining on board for security, the long-liner was escorted to São Tomé by the Sea Shepherd vessel Bob Barker.

On August 7, the Alemar Primero arrived in the fishing village of Neves where it will remain, pending investigations.

Since April 2016, under the name Operation Albacore, Sea Shepherd has been assisting the Government of Gabon to tackle illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing by providing the use of the Bob Barker as a civilian offshore patrol vessel operating in Gabonese waters, under the direction of the Gabonese Government.

In August, São Tomé and Príncipe sent two marines and one fisheries observer from São Tomé to join Sea Shepherd crew, Gabonese marines and Gabonese fisheries enforcement officers on board the Bob Barker, to further detect and deter illegal fishing in the Gulf of Guinea.

MADURAI: The Sri Lankan navy on Thursday arrested three Indians on charges of smuggling heroin.

Two of the arrested men have been identified as Thalvin Rajan and Levin of Thangachimadam coastal village near Rameswaram in Tamil Nadu. The marine police in Mandapam said they were investigating further to ascertain the identities of all the arrested men.

According to a statement on Sri Lankan navy website, personnel from SLNS Barana intercepted a fishing craft in the territorial waters of the island nation during a special operation. They apprehended three Indians and seized 2kg of heroin from them.

The arrested men, their fishing boat and seized heroin had been handed over to Colombo police narcotics bureau officials, the website stated.

Officials in the Seychelles have nabbed nearly 100 kilograms of heroin and other opiate-based substances believed to be Tanzania-bound.

The Iranian fishing boat was halted in a hail of bullets and seized by the Seychelles Coast Guard and the National Drugs Enforcement Agency (NDEA) on Saturday, April 16.

“We understand that the boat was headed for Tanzania,” says NDEA deputy chief officer Liam Quinn, speaking to the Seychelles News Agency.

“There was hundreds of metres of fishing lines but there was no evidence that they had ever been used,” says Quinn, who says the bust is the largest ever made in the Seychelles.

The 11 Iranian crew members are being questioned as the boat continues to be searched.

Over a ton of heroin has been seized by various naval forces patrolling the Indian Ocean in recent years.

The HMS Defender seized over a metric ton of high-grade hashish off the south coast of Oman on Tuesday, June 7, 2016.

MANAMA, Bahrain — The British navy seized more than a ton of high-grade hashish off the south coast of Oman on Tuesday, the Royal Navy said in a release.

A U.S. P-8 Poseidon maritime patrol aircraft assisted in the seizure by helping the British destroyer HMS Defender identify the suspect vessel from among fishing and other vessels, a Combined Maritime Forces release said.

A boarding team searched the dhow and found 51 bales of hashish, each weighing 20 kilograms (44 pounds). The value is estimated to have a street value in Western Europe of about 5.6 million British pounds ($8.10 million).

The Defender was participating in counternarcotics and counterterrorist operations for the Combined Maritime Forces.

Last month, Australian frigate HMAS Darwin and French frigate Nivose seized more than a ton of heroin in international waters in the Indian Ocean, according to the Combined Maritime Forces.

Drug and weapons trafficking is common in a region with some of the busiest shipping lanes in the world.

U.S. and international naval forces have also made a few high value weapons seizures in recent months, including a seizure of AK-47s, rocket-propelled grenade launchers and .50-caliber machine guns in March. U.S. officials said the weapons originated in Iran and were intended for Houthi Rebels in Yemen.

Combined Maritime Forces is a 31-nation partnership focused on maritime security in 3.2 million square miles of international waters.

Vietnam's Coast Guard detained a Thai vessel carrying 260,000 liters of gasoline without legal papers in the country’s exclusive economic zone on July 22, the government online news portal reported.

The TAKUZAN 111 was also carrying seven crew members without identity papers when it was captured.

The captain testified that there were 260,000 liters of gasoline on board, but failed to provide legal documents.

In a previous case, Coast Guard forces captured a Chinese ship on March 31, which was on its way supplying 100,000 liters of illegal gasoline to Chinese vessels fishing illegally in Vietnamese waters.

The Coast Guard said that the TAKUZAN 111 was not a tanker and did not have fire safety equipment or pollution controls in place, posing a threat to Vietnam’s marine environment.

The vessel and its cargo have been seized pending further investigations.

The Ministry of Defense said that fuel smuggling is common along coastal provinces with international harbors like the northern provinces of Quang Ninh and Hai Phong and the southern province of Vung Tau.

From 2013 to the end of 2015, Vietnamese forces seized about 21.3 million tons of illegal fuel, contributing more than VND270 billion ($12.1 million) to the state budget.

The Royal Malaysian Navy (RMN) has seized a Vietnamese boat for allegedly fishing in Malaysia’s Exclusive Economic Zone, the New Strait Times reported on Saturday.

The boat, with 12 fishermen on board, was boarded and seized at 9 a.m. on December 8 about 120 nautical miles from Malaysia’s Pulau Perhentian, the daily quoted a statement from the Naval Region Command 1 as saying.

“Further inspection found that none of the crew had valid identification documents or a valid permit to fish in the Exclusive Economic Zone,” the statement said.

The boat was towed to Pulau Perhentian before being handed over to the Malaysian Maritime Enforcement Agency for further action.

The seizure of the Vietnamese fishing boat is "an act of deterrence", as well as to convey the message that Malaysia is taking acts of encroachment or illegal activities by foreigners seriously, the statement said.

In the first six months of this year, 84 fishing boats and 608 Vietnamese fishermen have been seized for illegally fishing in the waters of neighboring countries such as Thailand, Indonesia and the Philippines.

Colonel Tran Van Nam from Vietnam’s Coast Guard explained that many fishermen are unaware of international maritime laws or the boundaries of Vietnam’s waters, so they unwittingly stray into foreign fishing zones. However, others are aware of their actions, Nam admitted.

To prevent illegal fishing, the country’s Fisheries Resources Surveillance Department is trying to raise awareness about maritime boundaries and international maritime laws, and conducts frequent patrols to prevent potential violations.

Joint media release Australian Fisheries Management Authority, Australian Border Force and Parks Australia

A Vietnamese fishing vessel suspected of illegally fishing in Australian waters has been apprehended off the coast of Cairns.

Maritime Border Command (MBC), a multi-agency task force within the Australian Border Force (ABF) working in cooperation with the Australian Fisheries Management Authority (AFMA) and Parks Australia apprehended the vessel and its 15 crew near Lihou reef in the Coral Sea.

The vessel was initially sighted on 3 February 2017 by an MBC surveillance aircraft, approximately 325 nautical miles east of Cairns, Queensland and 172 nautical miles inside the Australian Exclusive Economic Zone (AEEZ).

ABF Cutter Storm Bay responded to the sighting and after a short pursuit intercepted the vessel.

The crew were apprehended, with the vessel and crew being escorted to Cairns for further investigation by AFMA and Parks Australia for breaches ofAustralian Fisheries Management Act 1991 and the Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBC Act).

Acting Commander MBC Stephen Alexander said this is another example of the efforts of Australian Government agencies working together to detect and apprehend vessels illegally fishing in Australian waters.

“Australia’s maritime domain exceeds 10 million square kilometres, but no matter where these boats are, our officers will continue to work tirelessly and in collaboration with our partners to ensure that Australia’s waters remain free from illegal fishing,” Acting Commander Alexander said.

“Apprehension of this vessel should serve as a warning to illegal foreign fishers that this behaviour will not be tolerated in Australia’s waters.”

General Manager Fisheries Operations Peter Venslovas said although this was the 10th foreign boat caught since July 2016, the number of illegal boats fishing illegally in Australian waters is significantly down from record highs a decade ago.

“Our presence and strong enforcement efforts on the water along with our international efforts has resulted in the dramatic decline in illegal fishing,” Mr Venslovas said

“However, it is important to remain vigilant as the threat remains with illegal vessels operating in waters close to our borders.”

Parks Australia’s Director of Marine Parks Compliance, Dr Andrew Read, said Lihou Reef had been a sanctuary since 1982 and was one of Australia’s most pristine reef ecosystems.

“Ensuring illegal fishing activities including foreign fishing are stopped is essential for the protection and conservation of this highly valued marine habitat,” Dr Read said.

“Parks Australia shares the determination of our partnering agencies in responding rapidly to these potentially damaging incursions.”

Joint media release from Department of Immigration and Border Protection and The Australian Fisheries Management Authority

Maritime Border Command (MBC), a multi-agency task force within the Australian Border Force (ABF) working in cooperation with the Australian Fisheries Management Authority (AFMA) and the Australian Defence Force (ADF) apprehended a foreign fishing vessel suspected of illegally fishing in Australian waters.

The Vietnamese fishing vessel was initially sighted approximately 450km north-east of Gladstone during an MBC surveillance flight. HMAS Pirie responded to the sighting and after a short pursuit, intercepted the foreign fishing vessel 320km north-east of Gladstone.

Seventeen Vietnamese crew members were apprehended during the boarding of the vessel. While on board, officers located approximately seven tonnes of bêche-de-mer (sea cucumbers), 200 kilograms of fish and various diving equipment including air lines, weight belts, 16 masks, compressor and navigational equipment.

The vessel and its crew arrived into Gladstone today where further investigations will be undertaken by AFMA. The men will be detained while AFMA considers charges under the Australian Fisheries Management Act 1991.

This apprehension is another example of the efforts of Australian Government agencies working together to detect and apprehend vessels illegally fishing in Australian waters.

Intelligence assessment and aerial surveillance as part of the ABF’s maritime domain awareness in high priority areas provide early threat identification and a cue for on-water response, as demonstrated by recent apprehensions of Vietnamese fishing vessels in Australian waters.

Woman killed after leaving witness protection

Cape Town - Ocean View, a poor fishing village in Cape Town’s Deep South, has been rocked by violence and alleged intimidation by what is believed to be a syndicate controlling drugs, prostitution and illegal abalone fishing. The syndicate even reportedly recruits hitmen to assassinate witnesses. Ocean View residents told the Cape Argus they were scared to report any crime to the police out of fear they could become the next victim. The 2011 City of Cape Town census puts the population of Ocean View at slightly over 13 500 people. The 2015/2016 national crime statistics released earlier this year revealed an increase in violent crime. This is a direct result of a spike in gang activity, according to local police.

The local precinct has seen a 58 percent surge in murders compared to the previous year, going up from 26 cases to 41. It’s the highest it’s been in a decade.

The latest victim, Shireen “Linkie” Jacobs, 29, was found in a pool of blood in Hydra Avenue outside of Ocean View High at about 1.50am last Monday. It’s alleged members of the Junky Funky Kids shot her more than 10 times in her chest and hips. Police are investigating a case of murder, but no arrests have been made.

The mother of three had been one of the State’s key witnesses in the murder of Kim Roberts, 35, who was shot multiple times on December 5 last year at around 9pm.

A newlywed couple who had been socialising with Roberts were also killed. Leonardo and Shannon Fortune, both 31, were according to investigating officer, Craig Phillips, “at the wrong place at the wrong time”.

In a judgment handed down in the Simon’s Town Magistrate’s Court during a bail application in April, it was revealed a State witness, who was not named at the time, could place the accused Taswell Koopman, Mario Theunis, Tyron Taylor and Carl Barendilla at the scene of the triple murder.

Phillips testified Koopman had run past Jacobs with a firearm, and tried to shoot her in the face - but the gun had jammed.

She also told Phillips that Koopman’s accomplices had removed their balaclavas to blend in with the crowd of onlookers before police arrived

This gave Jacobs the opportunity to positively identify them. She recognised them because she had grown up with them, the court had heard.

Koopman had had a previous case of attempted murder where he was accused of shooting a rival gang member in the face. The case was later withdrawn.

Phillips told the court Theunis arrived at Jacobs’s house and threatened her. He allegedly told her not to report anything to police and offered her money in exchange for her silence.

She had refused to stay in witness protection despite the danger she was in.

Phillips said the Ocean View community was so scared of some gang members, residents refused to give statements to the police.

The community did not want the four men to be released and police reported a notable reduction in gang activity while they were being held in custody.

They were denied bail.

Jacobs’s mother, a 51-year-old woman who refused to give her name even after the Cape Argus team assured her it would not be published, said her daughter had run away from witness protection after initially refusing to be placed in the programme.

“She said she did not want to be a victim anymore. She did not want to run all her life. She wanted to be free, and now she is.”

Jacobs had been in witness protection for two weeks. There had been several attempts on her life since she told police what she had seen.

But last Monday, her mother said, the hitmen didn’t miss.

“I don’t know who her killer is. If he had walked past me in the street, I would not know that he had shot my baby.”

National Prosecuting Authority spokesman, Eric Ntabazalila, said prosecutors were not in a position to say how Jacobs’s death would impact on the State’s case against the four accused.

“We will only make that decision by the end of the week.”
